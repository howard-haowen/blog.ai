            "content": ". . Intro . To earn the freeCodeCamp certification on Data Analysis with Python, one has to complete five projects. This post goes through the steps for completing the one named Demographic Data Analyzer with the pandas library. For more background info, read the first post of this series. . Import . For this project, we need nothing but the pandas 🐼 library, which is preinstalled on Colab. This following graph summarizes its major use cases. . . We&#39;ll be primarily dealing with the following three types of objects: . Series | DataFrame | GroupBy | . import pandas as pd . Dataset . Let&#39;s first clone the project repo and change the current directory to boilerplate-demographic-data-analyzer. In it, you&#39;ll find the adult.data.csv file, which is the dataset. . repo_url = &quot;https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-demographic-data-analyzer&quot; !git clone {repo_url} %cd boilerplate-demographic-data-analyzer . Cloning into &#39;boilerplate-demographic-data-analyzer&#39;... remote: Enumerating objects: 22, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (22/22), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (19/19), done. remote: Total 22 (delta 7), reused 12 (delta 2), pack-reused 0 Unpacking objects: 100% (22/22), done. /content/boilerplate-demographic-data-analyzer . . Since we&#39;re dealing with a csv file, we&#39;ll load the dataset with the read_csv function and save it as the variable df, which is pretty much the default name for DataFrame objects. A sample of 10 records is shown below. . fname = &quot;adult.data.csv&quot; df = pd.read_csv(fname) df.sample(10) . age workclass fnlwgt education education-num marital-status occupation relationship race sex capital-gain capital-loss hours-per-week native-country salary . 21634 38 | Private | 179668 | HS-grad | 9 | Married-civ-spouse | Protective-serv | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 40 | Scotland | &lt;=50K | . 4268 36 | Private | 281021 | HS-grad | 9 | Never-married | Transport-moving | Not-in-family | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 45 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 1863 25 | Private | 176520 | HS-grad | 9 | Never-married | Craft-repair | Other-relative | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 10570 21 | ? | 188535 | Some-college | 10 | Never-married | ? | Own-child | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 22607 19 | Private | 243373 | 12th | 8 | Never-married | Sales | Other-relative | White | Male | 1055 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 13134 41 | State-gov | 180272 | Masters | 14 | Never-married | Prof-specialty | Own-child | White | Female | 0 | 0 | 35 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 14015 49 | Self-emp-inc | 119565 | Masters | 14 | Married-civ-spouse | Sales | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &gt;50K | . 32054 23 | Private | 335067 | Bachelors | 13 | Never-married | Sales | Not-in-family | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 50 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 14950 51 | Private | 74660 | 10th | 6 | Married-civ-spouse | Craft-repair | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &gt;50K | . 28137 49 | Private | 209146 | HS-grad | 9 | Married-civ-spouse | Transport-moving | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; height=&quot;24px&quot;viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; width=&quot;24px&quot;&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; .

Assignment . show_readme() . Assignment ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗ ║ Demographic Data Analyzer ║ ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝ In this challenge you must analyze demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database. Here is a sample of what the data looks like: | | age | workclass | fnlwgt | education | education-num | marital-status | occupation | relationship | race | sex | capital-gain | capital-loss | hours-per-week | native-country | salary | |:|:|:--|:|:- --|-:|:-|:|:|:- |:-|:|:|--:|:--|:- --| | 0 | 39 | State-gov | 77516 | Bachelors | 13 | Never-married | Adm-clerical | Not-in-family | White | Male | 2174 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &lt;=50K | | 1 | 50 | Self-emp-not-inc | 83311 | Bachelors | 13 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 13 | United-States | &lt;=50K | | 2 | 38 | Private | 215646 | HS-grad | 9 | Divorced | Handlers-cleaners | Not-in-family | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &lt;=50K | | 3 | 53 | Private | 234721 | 11th | 7 | Married-civ-spouse | Handlers-cleaners | Husband | Black | Male | 0 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &lt;=50K | | 4 | 28 | Private | 338409 | Bachelors | 13 | Married-civ-spouse | Prof-specialty | Wife | Black | Female | 0 | 0 | 40 | Cuba | &lt;=50K | You must use Pandas to answer the following questions: • How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column) • What is the average age of men? • What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor&#39;s degree? • What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K? • What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K? • What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week? • What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K? • What country has the highest percentage of people that earn &gt;50K and what is that percentage? • Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn &gt;50K in India. Use the starter code in the file demographic_data_analyzer. Update the code so all variables set to &quot;None&quot; are set to the appropriate calculation or code.

UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science. . . Steps . The assignment lists 9 questions, and I&#39;ll just follow the order in which they occur. . The pandas syntax is quite powerful, and a lot of things could happen with just one line of code. When I first started learning pandas, I wish there were some kind of visual aids that could show me the transformation of a dataset from one state to another. Luckily 😙, I came across the Pandas Tutor, which can be very helpful if you are a visual learner like me. With its help, I&#39;ll be providing links to various visualizations in due course. But bear in mind that for the purpose of visualization I only took 20 random records rather than the whole dataset. The point is to visualize a tranformation process, not to actually do data analysis on Pandas Tutor. . Q1: Race counts . To get the counts of each race, we group the dataset by race. Calling the groupby method on df returns a GroupBy object, which cannot be displayed. . df.groupby(&quot;race&quot;) . &lt;pandas.core.groupby.generic.DataFrameGroupBy object at 0x7f528fe884d0&gt; . In order to show some results, we&#39;ll have to call an additional method on the Groupby object. For instance, the size method returns the numbers we&#39;re looking for. Follow this link to see a visualization of this process. . race_count = df.groupby(&quot;race&quot;).size() race_count . race Amer-Indian-Eskimo 311 Asian-Pac-Islander 1039 Black 3124 Other 271 White 27816 dtype: int64 . I thought race_count would be the answer to the first question, but it didn&#39;t pass the unittest. If you look at the test_module.py file, you&#39;ll see that the expected values of race_count are in ascending order, which is not made clear in the instructions. So, we&#39;ll have to sort the race counts by calling the sort_values method on race_count and setting the value of ascending to be False. . race_count = df.groupby(&quot;race&quot;).size().sort_values(ascending=False) race_count . race White 27816 Black 3124 Asian-Pac-Islander 1039 Amer-Indian-Eskimo 311 Other 271 dtype: int64 . Q2: Average age of men . To get the average age of men, we first group the dataset by sex, then take the age column, and finally call the mean method. Many steps are going on here, follow this link to visualize each of them. . average_age = df.groupby(&quot;sex&quot;)[&quot;age&quot;].mean() average_age . sex Female 36.858230 Male 39.433547 Name: age, dtype: float64 . At this point, average_age is a Series object with two keys Female and Male. So we just need to specify the Male key to get the average age of men. Then we round it to the tenth by calling the builtin function round. . average_age_men = average_age[&quot;Male&quot;] print(f&quot;Before rounding: {average_age_men}&quot;) average_age_men = round(average_age_men, 1) print(f&quot;After rounding: {average_age_men}&quot;) . Before rounding: 39.43354749885268 After rounding: 39.4 . Q3: Percentage of people with a Bachelor degree . To answer this question, we&#39;ll first need the fraction of the number of people with a Bachelor degree over the total number of people. To get the numerator, let&#39;s first create a Boolean filter named edu_filt, which will return True if the value of the education column for a given row is Bachelors or False if otherwise. Then we can just use the bracket notation df[edu_filt] to create a view of the dataset that satisfies the education criterion. Follow this link to see a visualization. . While the original dataset has 32561 records, the filtered one has only 5355 records. Since each record represents a person, these two numbers are precisely what we&#39;re looking for. . edu_filt = df[&quot;education&quot;] == &quot;Bachelors&quot; df[edu_filt] . age workclass fnlwgt education education-num marital-status occupation relationship race sex capital-gain capital-loss hours-per-week native-country salary . 0 39 | State-gov | 77516 | Bachelors | 13 | Never-married | Adm-clerical | Not-in-family | White | Male | 2174 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 1 50 | Self-emp-not-inc | 83311 | Bachelors | 13 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 13 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 4 28 | Private | 338409 | Bachelors | 13 | Married-civ-spouse | Prof-specialty | Wife | Black | Female | 0 | 0 | 40 | Cuba | &lt;=50K | . 9 42 | Private | 159449 | Bachelors | 13 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial | Husband | White | Male | 5178 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &gt;50K | . 11 30 | State-gov | 141297 | Bachelors | 13 | Married-civ-spouse | Prof-specialty | Husband | Asian-Pac-Islander | Male | 0 | 0 | 40 | India | &gt;50K | . ... ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | . 32530 35 | ? | 320084 | Bachelors | 13 | Married-civ-spouse | ? | Wife | White | Female | 0 | 0 | 55 | United-States | &gt;50K | . 32531 30 | ? | 33811 | Bachelors | 13 | Never-married | ? | Not-in-family | Asian-Pac-Islander | Female | 0 | 0 | 99 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 32533 54 | Private | 337992 | Bachelors | 13 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial | Husband | Asian-Pac-Islander | Male | 0 | 0 | 50 | Japan | &gt;50K | . 32536 34 | Private | 160216 | Bachelors | 13 | Never-married | Exec-managerial | Not-in-family | White | Female | 0 | 0 | 55 | United-States | &gt;50K | . 32538 38 | Private | 139180 | Bachelors | 13 | Divorced | Prof-specialty | Unmarried | Black | Female | 15020 | 0 | 45 | United-States | &gt;50K | . 5355 rows × 15 columns . &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; height=&quot;24px&quot;viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; width=&quot;24px&quot;&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; . The number of records in a DataFrame object is accessible via the attribute shape, which returns a tuple of (number of records, number of columns). So here&#39;s how we arrive at the percentage we&#39;re after. . percentage_bachelors = (df[edu_filt].shape[0]/df.shape[0]) * 100 print(f&quot;Before rounding: {percentage_bachelors}&quot;) percentage_bachelors = round(percentage_bachelors, 1) print(f&quot;After rounding: {percentage_bachelors}&quot;) . Before rounding: 16.44605509658794 After rounding: 16.4 . Q4: Percentage of people with advanced education who make more than 50k . As in the previous question, we need to filter the dataset by the education column. But this time around, we&#39;re filtering three values (Bachelors, Masters, and Doctorate for higher degrees) rather than just one. So, it&#39;d be easier to create a Boolean filter by calling the isin method on df while providing a list of higher degrees as its argument. Let&#39;s save the filtered dataset as higher_education. Follow this link to visualize the filtering process. . higher_degrees = [&quot;Bachelors&quot;, &quot;Masters&quot;, &quot;Doctorate&quot;] higher_education_filt = df[&quot;education&quot;].isin(higher_degrees) higher_education = df[higher_education_filt] higher_education . age workclass fnlwgt education education-num marital-status occupation relationship race sex capital-gain capital-loss hours-per-week native-country salary . 0 39 | State-gov | 77516 | Bachelors | 13 | Never-married | Adm-clerical | Not-in-family | White | Male | 2174 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 1 50 | Self-emp-not-inc | 83311 | Bachelors | 13 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 13 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 4 28 | Private | 338409 | Bachelors | 13 | Married-civ-spouse | Prof-specialty | Wife | Black | Female | 0 | 0 | 40 | Cuba | &lt;=50K | . 5 37 | Private | 284582 | Masters | 14 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial | Wife | White | Female | 0 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 8 31 | Private | 45781 | Masters | 14 | Never-married | Prof-specialty | Not-in-family | White | Female | 14084 | 0 | 50 | United-States | &gt;50K | . ... ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | . 32538 38 | Private | 139180 | Bachelors | 13 | Divorced | Prof-specialty | Unmarried | Black | Female | 15020 | 0 | 45 | United-States | &gt;50K | . 32539 71 | ? | 287372 | Doctorate | 16 | Married-civ-spouse | ? | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 10 | United-States | &gt;50K | . 32544 31 | Private | 199655 | Masters | 14 | Divorced | Other-service | Not-in-family | Other | Female | 0 | 0 | 30 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 32553 32 | Private | 116138 | Masters | 14 | Never-married | Tech-support | Not-in-family | Asian-Pac-Islander | Male | 0 | 0 | 11 | Taiwan | &lt;=50K | . 32554 53 | Private | 321865 | Masters | 14 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &gt;50K | . 7491 rows × 15 columns . &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; height=&quot;24px&quot;viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; width=&quot;24px&quot;&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; . The number of records in higher_education is then the denominator of the fraction we&#39;re looking for. For the numerator, it&#39;ll be the number of records in higher_education that is additionally filtered by the salary column. So my first attempted solution was as follows. . salary_filt = df[&quot;salary&quot;] == &quot;&gt;50K&quot; higher_education_rich = (higher_education[salary_filt].shape[0]/higher_education.shape[0]) * 100 print(f&quot;Before rounding: {higher_education_rich}&quot;) higher_education_rich = round(higher_education_rich, 1) print(f&quot;After rounding: {higher_education_rich}&quot;) . Before rounding: 46.535843011613935 After rounding: 46.5 . /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:2: UserWarning: Boolean Series key will be reindexed to match DataFrame index. . Though I did get the correct percentage, a warning popped up saying that &quot;Boolean Series key will be reindexed to match DataFrame index.&quot; I thought I could just ignore the warning, but the solution ended up failing the unittest 😞. I later figured out what might have caused the warning. It&#39;s probably because the keys of the salary_filt Series don&#39;t match up with the index of the higher_education DataFrame, as shown below. . salary_filt = df[&quot;salary&quot;] == &quot;&gt;50K&quot; print(&quot;Keys of salary_filt &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;) print(salary_filt.keys()) print(&quot;Index of higher_education &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;) print(higher_education.index) . Keys of salary_filt &gt;&gt;&gt; RangeIndex(start=0, stop=32561, step=1) Index of higher_education &gt;&gt;&gt; Int64Index([ 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 19, 20, ... 32530, 32531, 32532, 32533, 32536, 32538, 32539, 32544, 32553, 32554], dtype=&#39;int64&#39;, length=7491) . To fix the problem, I redefined salary_filt based on the filtered higher_education rather than the original df. This way, all the keys of salary_filt would be equal to the index of higher_education. . salary_filt = higher_education[&quot;salary&quot;] == &quot;&gt;50K&quot; print(&quot;Keys of salary_filt match index of higher_education?&quot;) all(salary_filt.keys() == higher_education.index) . Keys of salary_filt match index of higher_education? . True . Once the salary filter is fixed, the warning is gone 😎! . salary_filt = higher_education[&quot;salary&quot;] == &quot;&gt;50K&quot; higher_education_rich = (higher_education[salary_filt].shape[0]/higher_education.shape[0]) * 100 print(f&quot;Before rounding: {higher_education_rich}&quot;) higher_education_rich = round(higher_education_rich, 1) print(f&quot;After rounding: {higher_education_rich}&quot;) . Before rounding: 46.535843011613935 After rounding: 46.5 . Q5: Percentage of people without advanced education who make more than 50k . The logic for this question is pretty much like that for the previous one, except that we&#39;ll first filter out people without higher degrees rather than those with them. To negate the Boolean filter higher_education_filt, we just need to add the ~ symbol in front of it. To see a visualization of the filtering process, follow this link. . lower_education = df[~ higher_education_filt] lower_education . age workclass fnlwgt education education-num marital-status occupation relationship race sex capital-gain capital-loss hours-per-week native-country salary . 2 38 | Private | 215646 | HS-grad | 9 | Divorced | Handlers-cleaners | Not-in-family | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 3 53 | Private | 234721 | 11th | 7 | Married-civ-spouse | Handlers-cleaners | Husband | Black | Male | 0 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 6 49 | Private | 160187 | 9th | 5 | Married-spouse-absent | Other-service | Not-in-family | Black | Female | 0 | 0 | 16 | Jamaica | &lt;=50K | . 7 52 | Self-emp-not-inc | 209642 | HS-grad | 9 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 45 | United-States | &gt;50K | . 10 37 | Private | 280464 | Some-college | 10 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial | Husband | Black | Male | 0 | 0 | 80 | United-States | &gt;50K | . ... ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | . 32556 27 | Private | 257302 | Assoc-acdm | 12 | Married-civ-spouse | Tech-support | Wife | White | Female | 0 | 0 | 38 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 32557 40 | Private | 154374 | HS-grad | 9 | Married-civ-spouse | Machine-op-inspct | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &gt;50K | . 32558 58 | Private | 151910 | HS-grad | 9 | Widowed | Adm-clerical | Unmarried | White | Female | 0 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 32559 22 | Private | 201490 | HS-grad | 9 | Never-married | Adm-clerical | Own-child | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 20 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 32560 52 | Self-emp-inc | 287927 | HS-grad | 9 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial | Wife | White | Female | 15024 | 0 | 40 | United-States | &gt;50K | . 25070 rows × 15 columns . &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; height=&quot;24px&quot;viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; width=&quot;24px&quot;&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; . Now that we&#39;ve got lower_education, we can use a salary filter as before to get a subset of lower_education, which, when divided by the total set, gives us the percentage we&#39;re looking for. . salary_filt = lower_education[&quot;salary&quot;] == &quot;&gt;50K&quot; lower_education_rich = (lower_education[salary_filt].shape[0]/lower_education.shape[0]) * 100 print(f&quot;Before rounding: {lower_education_rich}&quot;) lower_education_rich = round(lower_education_rich, 1) print(f&quot;After rounding: {lower_education_rich}&quot;) . Before rounding: 17.3713601914639 After rounding: 17.4 . Q6: Minimum hours per week . This question is the easiest of all. We simply grab the hours-per-week Series, and find out the minimal value in it by calling the methond min on it. The value is saved as min_work_hours for later use. . min_work_hours = df[&quot;hours-per-week&quot;].min() min_work_hours . 1 . Q7: Percentage of people working minimum hours per week who make more than 50k . Given min_work_hours, we can use a filter, named hour_filt, to filter out people who work minimum hours per week, a subset saved as min_hour_workers. This link shows how the filtered subset is created. . hour_filt = df[&quot;hours-per-week&quot;] == min_work_hours min_hour_workers = df[hour_filt] min_hour_workers . age workclass fnlwgt education education-num marital-status occupation relationship race sex capital-gain capital-loss hours-per-week native-country salary . 189 58 | State-gov | 109567 | Doctorate | 16 | Married-civ-spouse | Prof-specialty | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &gt;50K | . 1036 66 | Self-emp-inc | 150726 | 9th | 5 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial | Husband | White | Male | 1409 | 0 | 1 | ? | &lt;=50K | . 1262 69 | ? | 195779 | Assoc-voc | 11 | Widowed | ? | Not-in-family | White | Female | 0 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 5590 78 | ? | 363134 | HS-grad | 9 | Widowed | ? | Not-in-family | White | Female | 0 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 5632 45 | ? | 189564 | Masters | 14 | Married-civ-spouse | ? | Wife | White | Female | 0 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 5766 62 | ? | 97231 | Some-college | 10 | Married-civ-spouse | ? | Wife | White | Female | 0 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 5808 76 | ? | 211574 | 10th | 6 | Married-civ-spouse | ? | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 8447 67 | ? | 244122 | Assoc-voc | 11 | Widowed | ? | Not-in-family | White | Female | 0 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 9147 75 | ? | 260543 | 10th | 6 | Widowed | ? | Other-relative | Asian-Pac-Islander | Female | 0 | 0 | 1 | China | &lt;=50K | . 11451 27 | Private | 147951 | HS-grad | 9 | Never-married | Machine-op-inspct | Other-relative | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 19337 72 | ? | 76860 | HS-grad | 9 | Married-civ-spouse | ? | Husband | Asian-Pac-Islander | Male | 0 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 19750 23 | Private | 72887 | HS-grad | 9 | Never-married | Craft-repair | Own-child | Asian-Pac-Islander | Male | 0 | 0 | 1 | Vietnam | &lt;=50K | . 20072 65 | ? | 76043 | HS-grad | 9 | Married-civ-spouse | ? | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &gt;50K | . 20909 77 | Self-emp-not-inc | 71676 | Some-college | 10 | Widowed | Adm-clerical | Not-in-family | White | Female | 0 | 1944 | 1 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 22960 21 | Private | 184135 | HS-grad | 9 | Never-married | Machine-op-inspct | Own-child | Black | Male | 0 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 23536 69 | ? | 320280 | Some-college | 10 | Never-married | ? | Not-in-family | White | Male | 1848 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 24284 57 | Self-emp-not-inc | 56480 | HS-grad | 9 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial | Husband | White | Male | 0 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 25078 74 | Private | 260669 | 10th | 6 | Divorced | Other-service | Not-in-family | White | Female | 0 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 29752 69 | ? | 117525 | Assoc-acdm | 12 | Divorced | ? | Unmarried | White | Female | 0 | 0 | 1 | United-States | &lt;=50K | . 32525 81 | ? | 120478 | Assoc-voc | 11 | Divorced | ? | Unmarried | White | Female | 0 | 0 | 1 | ? | &lt;=50K | . &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; height=&quot;24px&quot;viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; width=&quot;24px&quot;&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; . Now, let&#39;s create a salary filter based on min_hour_workers. The number of records in min_hour_workers with the filter divided by the number without it times 100 produces the answer, which is saved as rich_percentage. . salary_filt = min_hour_workers[&quot;salary&quot;] == &quot;&gt;50K&quot; rich_percentage = (min_hour_workers[salary_filt].shape[0]/min_hour_workers.shape[0]) * 100 print(f&quot;Before rounding: {rich_percentage}&quot;) rich_percentage = round(rich_percentage, 1) print(f&quot;After rounding: {rich_percentage}&quot;) . Before rounding: 10.0 After rounding: 10.0 . Q8: Country with the highest percentage of people who make more than 50k . This question is perhaps the most challenging of all. My initial move was to create a GroupBy object first selected by by native-country then by salary, and call the size method on it. This would produce a Series of counts for &lt;=50K and &gt;50K in each country, as follows. Go to this page to see this process in action. . df.groupby([&quot;native-country&quot;, &quot;salary&quot;]).size() . native-country salary ? &lt;=50K 437 &gt;50K 146 Cambodia &lt;=50K 12 &gt;50K 7 Canada &lt;=50K 82 ... United-States &gt;50K 7171 Vietnam &lt;=50K 62 &gt;50K 5 Yugoslavia &lt;=50K 10 &gt;50K 6 Length: 82, dtype: int64 . But then it&#39;s cubersome to get the percentage of the counts for &gt;50K over total counts in each country. The solution I submited for the first time worked, but it was not neat enough. After tackling the problem on a different occasion, I came up with a cleaner solution, to be explained below. . Let&#39;s forget about the breakdown of percentages by countries for the time being, and work out a way to get the percentage for all the dataset. Calling the value_counts method on the salary Series creates another Series with unique values in it as keys and their counts as the corresponding values. Let&#39;s name it salary_counts. . salary_counts = df[&quot;salary&quot;].value_counts() salary_counts . &lt;=50K 24720 &gt;50K 7841 Name: salary, dtype: int64 . Now we can retrieve the number of people who make more than 50K by using the bracket notation. . salary_counts[&quot;&gt;50K&quot;] . 7841 . For the total number of people, we can just call the sum method on the salary_counts Series. . salary_counts.sum() . 32561 . With the two numbers in place, we&#39;re now ready to calculate the percentage, which is named rich_percentage. . rich_percentage = (salary_counts[&quot;&gt;50K&quot;]/salary_counts.sum()) * 100 rich_percentage . 24.080955744602438 . Next, to replicate what we just did, let&#39;s create a function named get_rich_percentage, which takes the salary Series as its argument and returns the percentage of people who make more than 50K. . def get_rich_percentage(salary_series): salary_counts = salary_series.value_counts() res = (salary_counts[&quot;&gt;50K&quot;]/salary_counts.sum()) * 100 return res . A test on the function gives us the expected number. . get_rich_percentage(df[&quot;salary&quot;]) . 24.080955744602438 . Then, we apply the get_rich_percentage function to each group of a GroupBy object named by_country, which is selected by the native-country column. The outcome, saved as rich_percentage_by_country, would have been a Series of percentages across countries, were it not for the KeyError I got 😞. . by_country = df.groupby(&quot;native-country&quot;) rich_percentage_by_country = by_country.apply(lambda group: get_rich_percentage(group[&quot;salary&quot;])) rich_percentage_by_country .

Having taken care of the key error, we now got the Series we&#39;re after 🙌. The only thing modified this time is to additionally call the sort_values method on the Series so that the numbers are in descending order.

One of the neatest way to go about this is to call the groupby method on rich_indians and then the size method on the resulting GroupBy object. . ind_occupations = rich_indians.groupby(&quot;occupation&quot;).size() ind_occupations . occupation Adm-clerical 1 Exec-managerial 8 Other-service 2 Prof-specialty 25 Sales 1 Tech-support 2 Transport-moving 1 dtype: int64 . Finally, we call the idxmax method on the ind_occupations Series to get the most popular occupation, which is Prof-specialty. . top_IN_occupation = ind_occupations.idxmax() top_IN_occupation . &#39;Prof-specialty&#39; . Put it together . Here&#39;s the complete code for this project, including the main function calculate_demographic_data and the helper function get_rich_percentage for Q8. . import pandas as pd fpath = &quot;adult.data.csv&quot; def get_rich_percentage(salary_series): salary_counts = salary_series.value_counts() if salary_counts.get(&quot;&gt;50K&quot;): res = (salary_counts.get(&quot;&gt;50K&quot;)/salary_counts.sum()) * 100 else: res = 0 return res def calculate_demographic_data(print_data=True): # Read data from file df = pd.read_csv(fpath) # Q1 How many of each race are represented in this dataset?

Recap . Once you finish the freeCodeCamp project Demographic Data Analyzer, you&#39;ll become comfortable doing data analysis with the pandas library while manipulating pandas objects like Series, DataFrame, and GroupBy. Starting from the next project, we&#39;ll enter the realm of visualization, drawing figures with the help of libraries like matplotlib and seaborn. Until then 👋! .",

            "content": ". . Intro . freeCodeCamp is a website where one can learn coding for free. Once you log in, you&#39;ll have free access to more than 8,000 tutorials 😇. What I like best about it is that you can earn free certifications by completing courses on various topics. These courses are pretty intense, and it&#39;ll take you at least 300 hours to finish any of them. For instance, I started Data Analysis with Python, Scientific Computing with Python, and Machine Learning with Python back in 2020, but didn&#39;t actually get any of them done until recently. . The major challenge is that all these courses involve some coding projects, which require much more time and attention than just watch tutorial videos and do multiple-choice quizzes. But I finally nailed Data Analysis with Python and earned this certification 🙌! . . This particular course covers the following five projects: . Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator | Demographic Data Analyzer | Medical Data Visualizer | Page View Time Series Visualizer | Sea Level Predictor | . The tools you&#39;ll be using are numpy and pandas for data wrangling and matplotlib and seaborn for visualization. I&#39;ve learned a lot By working on these projects, which are really worth my time. So I plan to document the learning process and write a post on each of the projects. . I&#39;m sure there are already some solutions somewhere on the internet, but I&#39;ll write down mine anyway and focus more on the thinking process than final codes. The only help I turned to was official documentations of Python libraries and some snippets on stackoverFlow. . With that, let&#39;s start with Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator, which is the easiest one of the five. . Import .

Assignment Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix. The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix. The returned dictionary should follow this format: ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ { │ │ &#39;mean&#39;: [axis1, axis2, flattened], │ │ &#39;variance&#39;: [axis1, axis2, flattened], │ │ &#39;standard deviation&#39;: [axis1, axis2, flattened], │ │ &#39;max&#39;: [axis1, axis2, flattened], │ │ &#39;min&#39;: [axis1, axis2, flattened], │ │ &#39;sum&#39;: [axis1, axis2, flattened] │ │ } │ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ If a list containing less than 9 elements is passed into the function, it should raise a ValueError exception with the message: &quot;List must contain nine numbers.&quot; The values in the returned dictionary should be lists and not Numpy arrays.

Submitting Copy your project&#39;s URL and submit it to freeCodeCamp. . Steps . Here&#39;re the steps that I&#39;m gonna go through: . I&#39;ll create a variable named matrix, which holds 9 numbers in a 3x3 matrix. | I&#39;ll calculate the values for summation on the matrix to see if everything works as expected. | I&#39;ll wrap the calculating process in a general function named get_results. | Create a matrix . One of the easiest ways to create a matrix is to call the np.array function with a list of numbers, which is turned into a NumPy one-dimentional array. Then you just call the reshape method on it to make it two-dimentional. . input = [num for num in range(9)] arr = np.array(input) matrix = arr.reshape(3, 3) . print(f&quot;arr: n{arr}&quot;) print(f&quot;matrix: n{matrix}&quot;) . arr: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8] matrix: [[0 1 2] [3 4 5] [6 7 8]] . Calculate the sum . To get the sum of all the numbers in matrix, just call the sum method on it. . flattened_sum = matrix.sum() flattened_sum . 36 . That was easy, but what comes next can be confusing. We&#39;re supposed to do summation along two axes, so let&#39;s first figure out whether axis1 contains results calcuated along columns or rows. It turns out that we&#39;ll get the sum of all the numbers along a column when we call the sum method on matrix with the axis argument specified as 0 and along a row when the axis value is 1. . axis1_sum = matrix.sum(axis=0) axis2_sum = matrix.sum(axis=1) print(f&quot;axis1_sum: n{axis1_sum}&quot;) print(f&quot;axis2_sum: n{axis2_sum}&quot;) . axis1_sum: [ 9 12 15] axis2_sum: [ 3 12 21] . The following graph illustrates the idea better than what I just said. . . Notice that axis1_sum is a NumPy array, but we&#39;re supposed to return it as a list. So we call the tolist method on axis1_sum to do the conversion. . old_type = type(axis1_sum) axis1_sum = axis1_sum.tolist() new_type = type(axis1_sum) print(f&quot;Old type: {old_type}&quot;) print(f&quot;New type: {new_type}&quot;) . Old type: &lt;class &#39;numpy.ndarray&#39;&gt; New type: &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; . Wrap calculations in a function . Now that we&#39;ve figured out how to get the values of axis1, axis2, and flattened for summation, we can just repeat the same process for the other 5 mathematical operations. So let&#39;s wrap the calculating process in a general function called get_results. It takes two arguments, one being op for the name of the mathematical operation to be done, and the other matrix. Luckily 😀, the numpy API is quite consistent across the 6 operations, so for each mathematical operation we just need to change the method name accordingly. . def get_results(op, matrix): if op == &quot;sum&quot;: axis1 = matrix.sum(axis=0).tolist() axis2 = matrix.sum(axis=1).tolist() flattened = matrix.sum() elif op == &quot;min&quot;: axis1 = matrix.min(axis=0).tolist() axis2 = matrix.min(axis=1).tolist() flattened = matrix.min() elif op == &quot;max&quot;: axis1 = matrix.max(axis=0).tolist() axis2 = matrix.max(axis=1).tolist() flattened = matrix.max() elif op == &quot;std&quot;: axis1 = matrix.std(axis=0).tolist() axis2 = matrix.std(axis=1).tolist() flattened = matrix.std() elif op == &quot;var&quot;: axis1 = matrix.var(axis=0).tolist() axis2 = matrix.var(axis=1).tolist() flattened = matrix.var() elif op == &quot;mean&quot;: axis1 = matrix.mean(axis=0).tolist() axis2 = matrix.mean(axis=1).tolist() flattened = matrix.mean() return [axis1, axis2, flattened] . . Now let&#39;s test the function with sum and var, for the sum and variance respectively. . get_results(&quot;sum&quot;, matrix) . [[9, 12, 15], [3, 12, 21], 36] . get_results(&quot;var&quot;, matrix) . [[6.0, 6.0, 6.0], [0.6666666666666666, 0.6666666666666666, 0.6666666666666666], 6.666666666666667] . The last thing that needs to be taken care of is error handling. We just need to raise ValueError with a specific message when the length of the input list is not 9. . def calculate(mylist): if len(mylist) != 9: raise ValueError(&quot;List must contain nine numbers.&quot;) else: pass . mylist = [1, 2, 3] calculate(mylist) . ValueError Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-3-6ee8fb3f03c3&gt; in &lt;module&gt;() 6 7 mylist = [1, 2, 3] -&gt; 8 calculate(mylist) &lt;ipython-input-3-6ee8fb3f03c3&gt; in calculate(mylist) 1 def calculate(mylist): 2 if len(mylist) != 9: -&gt; 3 raise ValueError(&#34;List must contain nine numbers.&#34;) 4 else: 5 pass ValueError: List must contain nine numbers. . Put it together . Finally, our final codes should be saved as mean_var_std.py and look like this: . import numpy as np def get_results(op, matrix): if op == &quot;sum&quot;: axis1 = matrix.sum(axis=0).tolist() axis2 = matrix.sum(axis=1).tolist() flattened = matrix.sum() elif op == &quot;min&quot;: axis1 = matrix.min(axis=0).tolist() axis2 = matrix.min(axis=1).tolist() flattened = matrix.min() elif op == &quot;max&quot;: axis1 = matrix.max(axis=0).tolist() axis2 = matrix.max(axis=1).tolist() flattened = matrix.max() elif op == &quot;std&quot;: axis1 = matrix.std(axis=0).tolist() axis2 = matrix.std(axis=1).tolist() flattened = matrix.std() elif op == &quot;var&quot;: axis1 = matrix.var(axis=0).tolist() axis2 = matrix.var(axis=1).tolist() flattened = matrix.var() elif op == &quot;mean&quot;: axis1 = matrix.mean(axis=0).tolist() axis2 = matrix.mean(axis=1).tolist() flattened = matrix.mean() return [axis1, axis2, flattened] def calculate(mylist): if len(mylist) != 9: raise ValueError(&quot;List must contain nine numbers.&quot;) else: matrix = np.array(mylist).reshape(3, 3) calculations = { &#39;mean&#39;: get_results(&#39;mean&#39;, matrix), &#39;variance&#39;: get_results(&#39;var&#39;, matrix), &#39;standard deviation&#39;: get_results(&#39;std&#39;, matrix), &#39;max&#39;: get_results(&#39;max&#39;, matrix), &#39;min&#39;: get_results(&#39;min&#39;, matrix), &#39;sum&#39;: get_results(&#39;sum&#39;, matrix), } return calculations . . Let&#39;s test the calculate function to ensure it works just as expected. And it did 🙌! . input = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] calculate(input) . {&#39;max&#39;: [[6, 7, 8], [2, 5, 8], 8], &#39;mean&#39;: [[3.0, 4.0, 5.0], [1.0, 4.0, 7.0], 4.0], &#39;min&#39;: [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 6], 0], &#39;standard deviation&#39;: [[2.449489742783178, 2.449489742783178, 2.449489742783178], [0.816496580927726, 0.816496580927726, 0.816496580927726], 2.581988897471611], &#39;sum&#39;: [[9, 12, 15], [3, 12, 21], 36], &#39;variance&#39;: [[6.0, 6.0, 6.0], [0.6666666666666666, 0.6666666666666666, 0.6666666666666666], 6.666666666666667]} . Recap . After you finish the freeCodeCamp project Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator, you&#39;ll be able to do some basic math using the numpy library. This first project is really just a warm-up, and it gets more challenging as we move on to the other four, which I&#39;ll blog (definitely not brag) about soon 👼. .",

            "content": ". Intro . Dcard is a popular social networking platform in Taiwan, and as such offers great resources for text mining and NLP model building. Our goals in this post is to scrape data from Dcard at regular intervals and persist it to a SQL database without duplicating the same records. We&#39;ll be leveraging the Dcard API v2 as well as the following libraries, which are not included in Python&#39;s standard library: . cloudscraper: for bypassing Cloudflare&#39;s anti-bot page | pandas: for organizing the scraped data into a tabular format, which can then be easily saved as a SQL table | schedule: for scheduling tasks | . Installing dependencies . Since pandas is preinstalled on Colab, we only need to install cloudscraper and schedule. . !pip install cloudscraper !pip install schedule #!pip pandas # uncomment this if pandas is not installed in your environment .

Let&#39;s check out the Python version on Colab. . !python --version . Python 3.7.11 . Testing the Dcard API . Let&#39;s first test the Dcard API v2 with cloudscraper, the syntax of which is much like that of requests. The only difference is that we&#39;ll have to first create a scraper instance with cloudscraper.create_scraper(). For each HTTP request, we&#39;ll get a batch of 30 posts. The forum variable in the URL is the English name of a forum, and we&#39;ll first test the one named stock. . import cloudscraper forum = &quot;stock&quot; URL = f&quot;https://www.dcard.tw/service/api/v2/forums/{forum}/posts&quot; scraper = cloudscraper.create_scraper() batch = scraper.get(URL).json() len(batch) . 30 .

Persisting data to SQL . We&#39;ll use the sqlite3 module to interact with a SQL database. First, the sqlite3.connect() function creates and then connects to a .db file, which we name Dcard.db. The next important thing to do is to create a table in the database. The create_table variable contains SQL syntax for creating a table named Posts with five columns, including createdAt, title, excerpt, categories, and topics. Crucially, we make the createdAt column the primary key so that posts with the same primary key will be ignored. The assumption here is that posts with the same timestamp are duplicates, though this might not be always the case.

Testing the logger . We&#39;ll use the logging module to create a log file named logging.txt, which can be configured by the logging.basicConfig() function. I&#39;d like the logging format to be [{timestamp}] {logging level} | {logging message}, so the value of the format argument is [%(asctime)s] %(levelname)s | %(message)s. In addition, the format of the timestamp can be set up by the datefmt argument. . import logging logging.basicConfig( filename=&#39;logging.txt&#39;, filemode=&quot;a&quot;, level=logging.INFO, format=&quot;[%(asctime)s] %(levelname)s | %(message)s&quot;, datefmt=&quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;, ) . Let&#39;s test out three types of logs and check out the logging file. . logging.info(&quot;This is an info.&quot;) logging.error(&quot;This an error!&quot;) logging.warning(&quot;This is a warning!&quot;) !head logging.txt . [2021-09-12 08:31:31] INFO | This is an info. [2021-09-12 08:31:31] ERROR | This an error! [2021-09-12 08:31:31] WARNING | This is a warning! . Testing the scheduler . We&#39;ll use the schedule library to activate our Dcard scraper at regular intervals. As a test for the scheduling function, the scheduler.py simply logs the current time to logging.txt every three seconds. The first step for scheduling a job is to define a function, which is named job() in this case. Then the job can be put on schedule by simply calling the schedule.every({num}).{unit}.do({job}) function, where {num} is an integer, {unit} a string for unit of time like seconds, minutes or hours, and finally {job} the function scheduled to run. Finally, if we call the schedule.run_pending() function within a while loop, the program will run indefinitely. Run the following cell to create scheduler.py. . %%writefile scheduler.py import schedule import time from datetime import datetime import logging logging.basicConfig( filename=&#39;logging.txt&#39;, filemode=&quot;a&quot;, level=logging.INFO, format=&quot;[%(asctime)s] %(levelname)s | %(message)s&quot;, datefmt=&quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;, ) def job(): now = datetime.now() message = f&quot;Hello, the current time is {now}.&quot; logging.info(message) schedule.every(3).seconds.do(job) schedule.run_all() #Without this line, the job will start in 3 seconds rather than immediately. while True: schedule.run_pending() time.sleep(1) . . Now run python scheduler.py in the terminal to test the scheduler, which will keep running unless stopped! If you run it for a while and then stop it, logging.txt will look something like this: . !tail logging.txt . [2021-09-12 08:31:31] ERROR | This an error!

Now that we&#39;ve covered all the components we need, let&#39;s remove logging.txt and Dcard.db to start afresh and put everything together. To do that, just run rm logging.txt Dcard.db in the terminal. . Putting everything together . Finally, it&#39;s time to put everything together. Run the following cell to create Dcard_scraper.py. The only thing new here is that this time around we are going to scrape multiple forums rather than just one. So we first create a dictionary called forums, where the keys are forum names in English and the values their equivalents in Chinese. We&#39;ll need the English forum names to get the API full URLs. Plus, we add two more columns in the Posts tabel of Dcard.db (i.e. forum_en and forum_zh) to store the forum names. The main() function takes care of iteration over every forum stored in the forums variable as well as some basic exception handling. . %%writefile Dcard_scraper.py import cloudscraper import logging import pandas as pd from random import randint import schedule import sqlite3 import time # Configuring the logging.txt file logging.basicConfig( filename=&#39;logging.txt&#39;, filemode=&quot;a&quot;, level=logging.INFO, format=&quot;[%(asctime)s] %(levelname)s | %(message)s&quot;, datefmt=&quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;, ) # Dcard API base URL baseURL = &quot;https://www.dcard.tw/service/api/v2/forums/&quot; # List of forums.

Now it&#39;s harvest time! Run python Dcard_scraper.py in the terminal to start the scraper, which will run every 30 minutes unless stopped.

            "title": "Training lecture for the International Linguistics Olympiad",
            "content": ". Intro . Recently, I had the honor of being invited to give a training lecture to the Taiwan team for the International Linguistics Olympiad. It’s basically an annual competition where participants from countries all over the world get together to solve linguistics puzzles. You don’t need to have official training in linguistics in order to solve those puzzles, though knowing some linguistics does help. That’s why I was asked to give this lecture. . A past problem set . The whole point of the competition is not so much the scope of linguistic knowledge one has as the analytic ability of identifying the systematic patterns buried in the given data. The process is actually quite similar to solving programming problems on LeetCode. . Take this problem set from the 16th competition in 2018 for instance1. . . The problem set is from Terêna, a language spoken in Brazil. Given the information provided here, participants are asked to fill in the gaps indicated by numbers 1 through 14. NLP models might be able to solve a problem like this one day, but that would require way more training data than provided here. But we humans are pretty good at making generalizations with only a limited amount of data. I encourage those of you who know little about linguistics to work on this puzzle before checking out the answer2. . Lecture slides . The Terêna problem set happens to be relevant to one of my favorite research topics, which is why I chose this title for my lecture: verbal person marking &amp; pronominal clitics. It may sound like gibberish if you don’t know anything about linguistics. Although the technical terms may sound obscure, the linguistic patterns they describe are in fact quite straightforward. To find out, check out some examples in the lecture slides below. . A problem set from Taiwan . In addition to the slides, I created a problem set based on a language of Taiwan, which is called Kavalan. You’ve probably heard of this name because of Kavalan Whisky. That’s right. This is the same Kavalan we’re talking about here. I wrote my MA thesis on the Kavalan language, but I’ve never tried Kavalan Whisky. . Here’s the Kavalan problem set, most examples of which are drawn from this paper3. .

            "title": "StackEdit makes blogging in Markdown easy-peasy",
            "content": ". Intro . FastPages supports blog posts in three file formats, including .ipynb for Jupyter, .md for Markdown and .docx for Microsoft Word. Each type of formats is supposed to be saved in a dedicated folder, respectively named _notebooks, _posts, and _word by FastPages. I’ve been using Colab to write posts in .ipynb because publishing them is as easy as saving them to GitHub. This can be done on Colab by doing: . File &gt; Save a copy in GitHub . Then all you need to do is select your FastPages repo on GitHub and the _notebooks folder. . But as for posts in .md, my workflow was not as smooth until I discovered StackEdit, which is an in-browser Markdown editor. So this post shows how StackEdit makes blogging in Markdown easy-peasy. . Adding a workspace . Once you’re on StackEdit, clicking on START WRITING is all that needs to be done to, umm…, start writing in Markdown. But what comes next is not that straightforward. It took me a while to figure it out. To sync a StackEdit browser instance with a folder on GitHub, you first need to add a workspace. This is done by clicking on the hashtag icon at the upper right corner. Then you do: . Workspaces &gt; Add a GitHub workspace . Then enter your FastPages repo URL and the _posts folder path (or any other GitHub folder). Now if you click on the folder icon at the upper left corner, you’ll see all your .md files in the the _posts folder like this: . . Now you can enjoy writing on StackEdit, and rest assured that all your local .md files (saved in the browser storage) will be synced with your GitHub folder. . By the way, I found a trick of quickly embedding an image on StackEdit. Suppose you have an image file stored on GitHub, you can just copy that file name in the tree view on GitHub and paste it on StackEdit. Take the image above for example, this is what you’ll see: . [StackEdit-snapshot.png](https://github.com/howard-haowen/blog.ai/blob/master/images/StackEdit-snapshot.png &quot;StackEdit-snapshot.png&quot;) . Then to display the image, you just need to add an exclamation mark at the beginning and replace blob with raw, like this: . ![StackEdit-snapshot.png](https://github.com/howard-haowen/blog.ai/raw/master/images/StackEdit-snapshot.png &quot;StackEdit-snapshot.png&quot;) . This trick saves you the trouble of typing out the embedding syntax. . Testing Markdown extensions . In addition to default Markdown syntax, StackEdit also supports some additional extensions, including SmartyPants, KaTeX, and UML diagrams. To test if these extensions will be properly rendered by FastPages, I simply copied and pasted examples from StackEdit down below: . . SmartyPants . SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into “smart” typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example: .   ASCII HTML . Single backticks | &#39;Isn&#39;t this fun?&#39; | ‘Isn’t this fun?’ | . Quotes | &quot;Isn&#39;t this fun?&quot; | “Isn’t this fun?” | . Dashes | -- is en-dash, is em-dash | – is en-dash, — is em-dash | . KaTeX . You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using KaTeX: . The Gamma function satisfying $ Gamma(n) = (n-1)! quad forall n in mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral . Γ(z)=∫0∞tz−1e−tdt . Gamma(z) = int_0^ infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt ,.Γ(z)=∫0∞​tz−1e−tdt. . You can find more information about LaTeX mathematical expressions here. .",

            "content": ". Before the outbreak of Covid-19, I couldn’t write any single line of code. But by teaching myself Python and machine learning during the lockdown period, I ended up being an AI engineer in mid-September in 2020. So I was invited to give a mini-talk on how to learn Python from scratch. I came up with a 4B learning path, covering basics, badges, and bootstrapping, and blogging. For those interested in the details, click on the title page at the bottom to view the slides. At first, I didn’t think the slides are worth sharing at all, but one of my old-time colleagues at Rice University told me that he saw them posted on LinkedIn and found them quite helpful. He even considered changing his career path and getting into data science. This is why I’m sharing the slides here. .",

            "title": "What I did to pass the Microsoft Exam DP-100 for data scientists",
            "content": ". Intro . It’s been a while since I posted anything here. And it’s primarily because I was busy preparing for the Microsoft DP-100 Exam, which is an associate (i.e. intermediate) level for designing and implementing data science solutions on Azure. I spent about 2 months preparing for it and got my certificate today! Here’s what it looks like. . . The certificate also comes with a dedicated Credly webpage, where people can verify its validity. In this post, I’ll share the resources that I perused for the prep work. They come from three sources: a book, two Udemy courses, and three kinds of official materials from Microsoft. . One book . . The book is entitled Data Science Solutions on Azure Tools and Techniques Using Databricks and MLOps, which is a good start if you don’t know anything about Azure or other cloud tools that Microsoft offers. One nice thing about this book is that it includes lots of snapshots of the Azure Machine Learning interface, which gives you a clear mental map of the workflow even if you don’t have an Azure account. . Two Udemy courses . Here’re the two Udemy courses that I took. . DP-100 Microsoft Azure Data Scientist Complete Exam Prep taught by Scott Duffy | DP-100: A-Z Machine Learning using Azure Machine Learning taught by Jitesh Khurkhuriya | . The first one is about 2.5 hours long and the second one has a staggering length of 32 hours, but they cost the same (i.e. NT$2,990 last time I checked)! The second one is long primarily because it covers a lot of the classic Azure ML Studio, which is gradually replaced by the updated Azure ML Designer. Also included is a primer on Python programming. I skipped this part, which is why I didn’t finish the second course, as indicated in my Udemy learning history. . . I don’t remember much from the first course while I find it hard to say the same to the second one. Its instructor, Jitesh, has a very personalized style of intonation, which makes even the dullest stuff sound interesting. He is not only pretty good at explaining complex concepts in simple and intuitive ways, but also meticulous about every bit of details regarding the exam. My only complaint about his course is the low speed at which he talks. I had to set the playback speed to x1.5 faster to stay awake. . Three kinds of official materials from Microsoft . Microsoft did an incredibly good job of making high-quality learning materials accessible to the public, which makes me feel that Microsoft really wants exam-takers to pass rather than fail. Here’re the three kinds of official materials that I went through. . 4 online learning paths Create machine learning models (5 Modules) | Use visual tools to create machine learning models with Azure Machine Learning (4 Modules) | Build and operate machine learning solutions with Azure Machine Learning (14 Modules) | Perform data science with Azure Databricks (12 Modules) | . | 17 ipynb files from the MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-dp100 repo | Documentation for Algorithm &amp; module reference for Azure Machine Learning designer | . The learning paths give you a high-level overview of what Azure ML products can do. The ipynb files cover pretty much all you need to know about Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python as far as the exam is concerned. They are so helpful that I forked the whole repo into this one, to which I added a note of crucial codes taken from all the 17 ipynb files. The last material is specfically about Azure ML Designer, and I made a summary note of the entire documentation. . . To navigate this long note, press the button with three bars and dots at the upper left corner of the markdown page. Some final notes about the exam. In hindsight, I believe I could still pass the exam even without taking the Udemy courses, considering the official materials from Microsoft already cover the great majority of questions. Next, the price for taking the exam varies depending on the country you choose even if you take it online. I did it online (who wouldn’t during the pandemic!), and the price for Taiwan is $125 USD (but $165 USD instead for the USA). Finally, you have a few options for the exam language, which can be English, Japanese, Chinese, or some others. But the exam proctor only speaks English or Japanese. I wonder why Microsoft offers Japanese as the only non-English language for proctors. .",

            "title": "Classifying customer reviews with spaCy v3.0",
            "content": ". . Intro . Text classification is a very common NLP task. Given enough training data, it&#39;s relatively easy to build a model that can automatically classify previously unseen texts in a way that follows the logic of the training data. In this post, I&#39;ll go through the steps for building such a model. Specifically, I&#39;ll leverage the power of the recently released spaCy v3.0 to train two classification models, one for identifying the sentiment of customer reviews in Chinese as being positive or negative (i.e. binary classification) and the other for predicting their product categories in a list of five (i.e. multiclass classification). If you can&#39;t wait to see how spaCy v3.0 has made the training process an absolute breeze, feel free to jump to the training the textcat component with CLI section. If not, bear with me on this long journey. All the datasets and models created in this post are hosted in this repo of mine. . Preparing the dataset . Getting the dataset . I&#39;m hoping to build classification models that can take traditional Chinese texts as input, but I can&#39;t find any publicly available datasets of customer reviews in traditional Chinese. So I had to make do with reviews in simplified Chinese.

Before moving on, let&#39;s save the raw dataset to Google Drive. The dest variable can be any GDrive path you like. . dest = &quot;/content/drive/MyDrive/Python/NLP/shopping_comments/&quot; !cp {file_path} {dest} . Filtering the datases . Now let&#39;s do some data filtering. The groupby function from pandas is very useful, and here&#39;s how to get the counts of each of the unique values in the cat column. . df.groupby(by=&#39;cat&#39;).size() . cat 书籍 3851 平板 10000 手机 2323 水果 10000 洗发水 10000 热水器 575 蒙牛 2033 衣服 10000 计算机 3992 酒店 10000 dtype: int64 . To create a balanced dataset, I decided to keep categories whose counts are 10,000. So we&#39;re left with five product categories, 平板 for tablets, 水果 for fruits, 洗发水 for shampoo, 衣服 for clothing, and finally 酒店 for hotels. . There&#39;re many ways to filter data in pandas, and my favorite is to first create a filt variable that holds a list of True and False, which in this particular case is whether the value in the cat volumn is in the cat_list variable for the categories to be kept. Then we can simply filter data with df[filt]. After filtering, the dataset is reduced to 50,000 reviews. . cat_list = [&#39;平板&#39;, &#39;水果&#39;, &#39;洗发水&#39;, &#39;衣服&#39;, &#39;酒店&#39;] filt = df[&#39;cat&#39;].isin(cat_list) df = df[filt] df.shape . (50000, 3) . Now, the dataset is balanced in terms of both the cat and label columnn. There&#39;re 10,000 reviews for each product category. . df.groupby(by=&#39;cat&#39;).size() . cat 平板 10000 水果 10000 洗发水 10000 衣服 10000 酒店 10000 dtype: int64 . And there&#39;re 25,000 for either of the two sentiments. . df.groupby(by=&#39;label&#39;).size() . label 0 25000 1 25000 dtype: int64 . Having made sure the filtered dataset is balanced, we can now reset the index, and save the dataset as online_shopping_5_cats_sim.csv. . df.reset_index(inplace=True, drop=True) df.to_csv(dest+&quot;online_shopping_5_cats_sim.csv&quot;, sep=&quot;,&quot;, index=False) . Converting the dataset to traditional Chinese . Let&#39;s load back the file we just saved to make sure the dataset is accessible for later use. . df = pd.read_csv(dest+&quot;online_shopping_5_cats_sim.csv&quot;) df.tail() . cat label review . 49995 酒店 | 0 | 我们去盐城的时候那里的最低气温只有4度，晚上冷得要死，居然还不开空调，投诉到酒店客房部，得到... | . 49996 酒店 | 0 | 房间很小，整体设施老化，和四星的差距很大。毛巾太破旧了。早餐很简陋。房间隔音很差，隔两间房间... | . 49997 酒店 | 0 | 我感觉不行。。。性价比很差。不知道是银川都这样还是怎么的！ | . 49998 酒店 | 0 | 房间时间长，进去有点异味！服务员是不是不够用啊！我在一楼找了半个小时以上才找到自己房间，想找... | . 49999 酒店 | 0 | 老人小孩一大家族聚会，选在吴宫泛太平洋，以为新加坡品牌一定很不错，没想到11点30分到前台，... | .

Before building models, I would normally inspect the dataset. There&#39;re many ways to do so. I recently learned that there&#39;s a trick on Colab which allows you to filter a dataset in an interactive manner. All it takes is three lines of code. . %load_ext google.colab.data_table from google.colab import data_table data_table.DataTable(df, include_index=False, num_rows_per_page=10) . Alternatively, if you&#39;d like to see some sample reviews from all the categories, the groupby function is quite handy. The trick here is to feed pd.DataFrame.sample to the apply function so that you can specify the number of reviews to inspect from each product category. . df.groupby(&#39;cat&#39;).apply(pd.DataFrame.sample, n=3)[[&#39;label&#39;, &#39;review&#39;]] . label review . cat . 平板 6247 0 | 這個平板真的是3G的嗎？你們有沒有忽悠唉，為什麼我下了一個百度影片，就卡的要死要活的，跟我以... | . 1081 1 | 看網頁玩王者榮耀都很流暢，音質畫面都不錯，就是稍微重了點，綜合性價比還是很好的 | . 1042 1 | 我覺得還可以，就是把膜貼上了之後，有點滑不動，打遊戲的時候就很煩了 | . 水果 10468 1 | 還不錯，這個價格比我在外面買的划算，以後還會經常來，個頭不是很大，還可以吧 | . 10986 1 | 蘋果味道好，就是小了一點，比想象的要小量了一下，好像基本上都沒到70毫米。快遞還是挺快的包裝... | . 18062 0 | 這是我在京東消費這麼多年來買到唯一次最爛的東西，還是自營一斤6塊錢的就這貨色還有一個是壞的，... | . 洗髮水 23271 1 | 很好，很舒服，清揚就是好用，謝謝老闆，希望一直好用，好好好好好好好好好，快樂 | . 21992 1 | 一如既往的好 京東速度快 值得信賴 優惠多多 | . 21867 1 | 京東購物 多快好省 寫評論真的很累 有木有 每次商品很滿意就用這個 各位大佬請放心購買 | . 衣服 30157 1 | 褲子質量不錯，貨真價實，和店家介紹的基本相符，大小合適，樣式也很滿意，穿上褲子走路感到很輕便，舒服 | . 33190 1 | 做工精細穿起來很舒服，質量很好 | . 35326 0 | 質量很差，沒有想象的那麼好 | . 酒店 42243 1 | 房間是新裝修的,用的是淺色調,感覺很溫馨,佈局較合理,顯的比較寬敞.酒店選用的布草很講究,放... | . 48082 0 | 實在忍無可忍。1、水。缺水現象——洗澡至中途，突然斷水，望著滿身的肥皂泡欲哭無淚；多水現象—... | . 49552 0 | 下雨天冷，想洗熱水澡，可惜開了半小時水還是冷的 | .

In order to render an interative visualization of the dataset, we first convert the DataFrame object df to the json format and then add it to an HTML template, as shown below. If you choose len for Binning | X-Axis, cat for Binning | Y-Axis, and finally review for Label By, you&#39;ll see all the reviews are beautifully arranged in term of text length along the X axis and product categories along the Y axis. They&#39;re also color-coded with respect to sentiment, blue for positive and red for negative. Clicking on a point of either color shows the values of that particular datapoint. Feel free to play around. . from IPython.core.display import display, HTML jsonstr = df.to_json(orient=&#39;records&#39;) HTML_TEMPLATE = &quot;&quot;&quot; &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/webcomponentsjs/1.3.3/webcomponents-lite.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;import&quot; href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PAIR-code/facets/1.0.0/facets-dist/facets-jupyter.html&quot;&gt; &lt;facets-dive id=&quot;elem&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/facets-dive&gt; &lt;script&gt; var data = {jsonstr}; document.querySelector(&quot;#elem&quot;).data = data; &lt;/script&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot; html = HTML_TEMPLATE.format(jsonstr=jsonstr) display(HTML(html)) . . Training spaCy models . Instantiating a pretrained spaCy model . spaCy supports many pretrained models in multiple languages, and offers a convenient widget for working out the code for downloading a particular model for a particular language. I specifically picked zh_core_web_md for Chinese. . !pip install -U pip setuptools wheel !pip install -U spacy !python -m spacy download zh_core_web_md . Everthing in spaCy starts with loading a model. The model we downloaded has five built-in components, accessible via the pipe_names attribute. . import spacy nlp=spacy.load(&quot;zh_core_web_md&quot;) nlp.pipe_names . [&#39;tok2vec&#39;, &#39;tagger&#39;, &#39;parser&#39;, &#39;ner&#39;, &#39;attribute_ruler&#39;] . Let&#39;s call the nlp object with a sample review text and print out its tokens to make sure the model is working. . test = df.loc[22, &#39;review&#39;] doc = nlp(test) for tok in doc: print(tok.text, tok.pos_) . 買 VERB 了 PART 送人 NOUN 的 PART ， PUNCT 沒有 VERB 拆開 NOUN ， PUNCT 包裝 VERB 高大上 NOUN ， PUNCT 以前 NOUN 自用 VERB 買 VERB 了 PART 一 NUM 個 NUM ， PUNCT 這次 ADJ 活動 NOUN 便宜 VERB 好 VERB 幾百 VERB ， PUNCT 價格 NOUN 好 ADV 划算 VERB 啊 PART ， PUNCT 以後 NOUN 還會 VERB 降價 NOUN 嗎 VERB ？？？ PUNCT . . Converting the dataset to spaCy format for training . To train a classification model wtih spaCy, we have to convert our dataset to spaCy format. Before that, we&#39;ll create a directory called data under the current working directory cwd. This is where we&#39;ll save the data in spaCy format. . . Tip: I find the os.makedirs function much more useful than the more commonly seen os.mkdir() function because the former creates all the intermediate directories for you if they don&#8217;t exist yet. . import os def create_dir(dir_name): cwd = os.getcwd() project_dir = os.path.join(cwd, dir_name) os.makedirs(project_dir) return project_dir project_dir = create_dir(&quot;data&quot;) project_dir . . &#39;/content/data&#39; . The first step for the conversion is to create a list of tuples with two elements, one for the text and the other for the text class label. Let&#39;s start with the binary classification for sentiment first and generalize to multiclass classification for product categories later. . The easiest way to generate such a list is to create a new column called tuples (or whatever), whose values are derived by applying a lambda function to review for text and label for text class. I learned this trick from this article. Here&#39;re the first 10 tuples in the newly created dataset list. . df[&#39;tuples&#39;] = df.apply(lambda row: (row[&#39;review&#39;], row[&#39;label&#39;]), axis=1) dataset = df[&#39;tuples&#39;].tolist() dataset[:10] .

Then I split the dataset using train_test_split from scikit-learn. The train_data and valid_data hold 80% and 20% of the dataset, respectively. . from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split train_data, valid_data = train_test_split(dataset, test_size=0.2, random_state=1) . Then we need to turn the dataset list into spaCy Doc objects and assign text classes to each of them so that the model can start learning. Assigning text classes is the trickiest part and took me lots of trials and errors to figure out. Unfortunately, official documentation of spaCy is not very clear about this part. At first, I used this make_docs function from p-sodmann/Spacy3Textcat to create Doc objects. That was successful, but the trained model gave weird results. Then I realized that the values of text classes need to be either True or False. So here&#39;s my revised version of the make_docs function. The trick here is to use bool(label), which will be True if the value of the label is 1 and False if its value is 0. . from tqdm.auto import tqdm from spacy.tokens import DocBin def make_docs(data): &quot;&quot;&quot; this will take a list of texts and labels and transform them in spacy documents texts: List(str) labels: List(labels) returns: List(spacy.Doc.doc) &quot;&quot;&quot; docs = [] # nlp.pipe([texts]) is way faster than running nlp(text) for each text # as_tuples allows us to pass in a tuple, the first one is treated as text # the second one will get returned as it is. for doc, label in tqdm(nlp.pipe(data, as_tuples=True), total = len(data)): # we need to set the (text)cat(egory) for each document doc.cats[&quot;POSITIVE&quot;] = bool(label) doc.cats[&quot;NEGATIVE&quot;] = not bool(label) # put them into a nice list docs.append(doc) return docs . spaCy v3.0 introduces the DocBin class, which is the recommended container for serializing a list of Doc objects, much like the pickle format, but better. After we create a list of Doc objects with the make_docs function, we can then generate an instance of the DocBin class for holding that list and save the serialized object to disk by calling the to_disk function. We first do this to valid_data and save the serialized file as valid.spacy in the data directory. . valid_docs = make_docs(valid_data) doc_bin = DocBin(docs=valid_docs) doc_bin.to_disk(&quot;./data/valid.spacy&quot;) . Then we do the same thing to train_data and save it as train.spacy. This will take much more time to run since train_data is much larger than valid_data. . train_docs = make_docs(train_data) doc_bin = DocBin(docs=train_docs) doc_bin.to_disk(&quot;./data/train.spacy&quot;) . And that was the end of the converting process! Now I&#39;d like to save the serialized data for later use, so I copied it to dest, which is a directory in my Google Drive. . . Note: Remember to use the -R flag when copying whatever in a directory to another. . source = &quot;/content/data&quot; dest = &quot;/content/drive/MyDrive/Python/NLP/shopping_comments/spaCy-sentiment-model/&quot; !cp -R {source} {dest} . Training the textcat component with CLI . spaCy v3.0 offers a nice and easy way to train spaCy&#39;s textcat component with a command line interfact (CLI). The first step is to get the base_config.cfg file, which is generated for you if you use spaCy&#39;s quickstart widget. The only thing that needs to changed is train and dev under [paths], which indicate where the serialized files are stored. . %%writefile base_config.cfg # This is an auto-generated partial config. To use it with &#39;spacy train&#39; # you can run spacy init fill-config to auto-fill all default settings: # python -m spacy init fill-config ./base_config.cfg ./config.cfg [paths] train = &quot;data/train.spacy&quot; dev = &quot;data/valid.spacy&quot; [system] gpu_allocator = null [nlp] lang = &quot;zh&quot; pipeline = [&quot;tok2vec&quot;,&quot;textcat&quot;] batch_size = 1000 [components] [components.tok2vec] factory = &quot;tok2vec&quot; [components.tok2vec.model] @architectures = &quot;spacy.Tok2Vec.v2&quot; [components.tok2vec.model.embed] @architectures = &quot;spacy.MultiHashEmbed.v1&quot; width = ${components.tok2vec.model.encode.width} attrs = [&quot;ORTH&quot;, &quot;SHAPE&quot;] rows = [5000, 2500] include_static_vectors = false [components.tok2vec.model.encode] @architectures = &quot;spacy.MaxoutWindowEncoder.v2&quot; width = 96 depth = 4 window_size = 1 maxout_pieces = 3 [components.textcat] factory = &quot;textcat&quot; [components.textcat.model] @architectures = &quot;spacy.TextCatBOW.v1&quot; exclusive_classes = true ngram_size = 1 no_output_layer = false [corpora] [corpora.train] @readers = &quot;spacy.Corpus.v1&quot; path = ${paths.train} max_length = 2000 [corpora.dev] @readers = &quot;spacy.Corpus.v1&quot; path = ${paths.dev} max_length = 0 [training] dev_corpus = &quot;corpora.dev&quot; train_corpus = &quot;corpora.train&quot; [training.optimizer] @optimizers = &quot;Adam.v1&quot; [training.batcher] @batchers = &quot;spacy.batch_by_words.v1&quot; discard_oversize = false tolerance = 0.2 [training.batcher.size] @schedules = &quot;compounding.v1&quot; start = 100 stop = 1000 compound = 1.001 [initialize] vectors = null . . Writing base_config.cfg . Then we create the config.cfg configuration file with base_config.cfg by using this command. . !python -m spacy init fill-config ./base_config.cfg ./config.cfg . 2021-03-05 01:43:52.105583: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:49] Successfully opened dynamic library libcudart.so.11.0 ✔ Auto-filled config with all values ✔ Saved config config.cfg You can now add your data and train your pipeline: python -m spacy train config.cfg --paths.train ./train.spacy --paths.dev ./dev.spacy . Here comes the fun part, where we can see how a computer model learns over time! The initial score was 43, which is worse than chance. But only after 200 iterations, the score already skyrocketed to 83! By the end of the training, we got a score of 92, which is pretty awesome, considering that we didn&#39;t do any text preprocessing. . !python -m spacy train ./config.cfg --output ./output . 2021-03-05 01:44:00.345586: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:49] Successfully opened dynamic library libcudart.so.11.0 ✔ Created output directory: output ℹ Using CPU =========================== Initializing pipeline =========================== Set up nlp object from config Pipeline: [&#39;tok2vec&#39;, &#39;textcat&#39;] Created vocabulary Finished initializing nlp object Initialized pipeline components: [&#39;tok2vec&#39;, &#39;textcat&#39;] ✔ Initialized pipeline ============================= Training pipeline ============================= ℹ Pipeline: [&#39;tok2vec&#39;, &#39;textcat&#39;] ℹ Initial learn rate: 0.001 E # LOSS TOK2VEC LOSS TEXTCAT CATS_SCORE SCORE - 0 0 0.00 0.06 43.32 0.43 0 200 0.00 34.18 83.25 0.83 0 400 0.00 21.43 86.60 0.87 0 600 0.00 12.77 87.25 0.87 0 800 0.00 15.29 89.00 0.89 0 1000 0.00 11.78 89.71 0.90 0 1200 0.00 5.92 89.62 0.90 0 1400 0.00 4.52 89.98 0.90 0 1600 0.00 1.51 90.40 0.90 0 1800 0.00 4.41 90.82 0.91 0 2000 0.00 0.80 90.76 0.91 0 2200 0.00 1.53 90.97 0.91 0 2400 0.00 0.16 91.06 0.91 0 2600 0.00 0.37 91.34 0.91 0 2800 0.00 0.13 91.33 0.91 0 3000 0.00 0.16 91.40 0.91 0 3200 0.00 0.20 91.56 0.92 0 3400 0.00 0.38 91.57 0.92 0 3600 0.00 0.10 91.70 0.92 1 3800 0.00 0.12 91.41 0.91 1 4000 0.00 0.17 91.65 0.92 1 4200 0.00 0.10 91.54 0.92 1 4400 0.00 0.14 91.58 0.92 1 4600 0.00 0.15 91.58 0.92 1 4800 0.00 0.19 91.59 0.92 1 5000 0.00 0.09 91.66 0.92 1 5200 0.00 2.16 91.91 0.92 1 5400 0.00 0.12 91.86 0.92 1 5600 0.00 0.21 91.68 0.92 1 5800 0.00 0.10 91.69 0.92 2 6000 0.00 2.18 91.22 0.91 2 6200 0.00 0.15 91.50 0.92 2 6400 0.00 0.16 91.61 0.92 2 6600 0.00 0.10 91.67 0.92 2 6800 0.00 0.11 91.57 0.92 ✔ Saved pipeline to output directory output/model-last . . spaCy automatically saves two models to the path specified by the --output argument.

In the make_doc function above, we hardcoded the string names of text classes, that is, POSITIVE and NEGATIVE. That was not a good option since the function cannot be reused in other cases. So I&#39;d like a general function that works just as well even if we don&#39;t know in advance how many text classes there are in the dataset and what their string names are. After doing some experiments, I finally came up with the make_docs_multiclass function, which does the job. The trick here is to create the label_dict dictionary with every unique class name as keys and False as their default values for every Doc object in the for-loop. Then we assign label_dict to the cats attribute of every Doc object, that is, doc.cats = label_dict. At last, we update the value of a class in label_dict to True only when that is the class of the Doc object in question. . unique_labels = df.cat.unique().tolist() def make_docs_multiclass(data): &quot;&quot;&quot; this will take a list of texts and labels and transform them in spacy documents texts: List(str) labels: List(labels) returns: List(spacy.Doc.doc) &quot;&quot;&quot; docs = [] # nlp.pipe([texts]) is way faster than running nlp(text) for each text # as_tuples allows us to pass in a tuple, the first one is treated as text # the second one will get returned as it is. for doc, label in tqdm(nlp.pipe(data, as_tuples=True), total = len(data)): label_dict = {label: False for label in unique_labels} # we need to set the (text)cat(egory) for each document doc.cats = label_dict doc.cats[label] = True # put them into a nice list docs.append(doc) return docs . . Then we split the dataset, convert it to sapCy format, save the converted data, and train a model with CLI, just like we did earlier. . from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split train_data, valid_data = train_test_split(dataset, test_size=0.2, random_state=1) . . valid_docs = make_docs_multiclass(valid_data) doc_bin = DocBin(docs=valid_docs) doc_bin.to_disk(&quot;./data/valid.spacy&quot;) . train_docs = make_docs_multiclass(train_data) doc_bin = DocBin(docs=train_docs) doc_bin.to_disk(&quot;./data/train.spacy&quot;) . source = &quot;/content/data&quot; dest = &quot;/content/drive/MyDrive/Python/NLP/shopping_comments/spaCy-product-cat-model/&quot; !cp -R {source} {dest} . After training, we got an overall score of 89, which is pretty awesome. . !python -m spacy train ./config.cfg --output ./output-multiclass . 2021-03-05 03:12:00.200786: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:49] Successfully opened dynamic library libcudart.so.11.0 ✔ Created output directory: output-multiclass ℹ Using CPU =========================== Initializing pipeline =========================== Set up nlp object from config Pipeline: [&#39;tok2vec&#39;, &#39;textcat&#39;] Created vocabulary Finished initializing nlp object Initialized pipeline components: [&#39;tok2vec&#39;, &#39;textcat&#39;] ✔ Initialized pipeline ============================= Training pipeline ============================= ℹ Pipeline: [&#39;tok2vec&#39;, &#39;textcat&#39;] ℹ Initial learn rate: 0.001 E # LOSS TOK2VEC LOSS TEXTCAT CATS_SCORE SCORE - 0 0 0.00 0.09 0.00 0.00 0 200 0.00 45.82 37.83 0.38 0 400 0.00 14.59 63.48 0.63 0 600 0.00 12.88 71.83 0.72 0 800 0.00 12.18 76.29 0.76 0 1000 0.00 5.34 78.87 0.79 0 1200 0.00 3.11 80.73 0.81 0 1400 0.00 4.12 82.13 0.82 0 1600 0.00 1.41 82.99 0.83 0 1800 0.00 0.76 83.86 0.84 0 2000 0.00 0.58 84.57 0.85 0 2200 0.00 0.40 85.13 0.85 0 2400 0.00 0.22 85.54 0.86 0 2600 0.00 0.24 86.10 0.86 0 2800 0.00 0.17 86.51 0.87 0 3000 0.00 0.30 86.82 0.87 0 3200 0.00 0.20 87.06 0.87 0 3400 0.00 0.26 87.13 0.87 0 3600 0.00 0.14 87.48 0.87 1 3800 0.00 0.13 87.73 0.88 1 4000 0.00 0.13 87.80 0.88 1 4200 0.00 0.31 87.80 0.88 1 4400 0.00 0.12 88.07 0.88 1 4600 0.00 0.25 88.07 0.88 1 4800 0.00 0.26 87.97 0.88 1 5000 0.00 0.10 88.25 0.88 1 5200 0.00 0.20 88.27 0.88 1 5400 0.00 0.15 88.39 0.88 1 5600 0.00 0.13 88.51 0.89 1 5800 0.00 0.11 88.53 0.89 2 6000 0.00 0.16 88.77 0.89 2 6200 0.00 0.15 88.39 0.88 2 6400 0.00 0.15 88.67 0.89 2 6600 0.00 0.11 88.77 0.89 2 6800 0.00 0.11 88.65 0.89 2 7000 0.00 0.14 88.73 0.89 2 7200 0.00 0.11 88.69 0.89 2 7400 0.00 0.17 88.67 0.89 2 7600 0.00 0.17 88.58 0.89 2 7800 0.00 0.11 88.68 0.89 2 8000 0.00 0.28 88.96 0.89 3 8200 0.00 0.21 88.93 0.89 3 8400 0.00 0.11 88.91 0.89 3 8600 0.00 0.23 88.86 0.89 3 8800 0.00 0.15 88.80 0.89 3 9000 0.00 0.11 88.95 0.89 3 9200 0.00 0.30 88.90 0.89 3 9400 0.00 0.11 89.11 0.89 3 9600 0.00 0.12 89.14 0.89 3 9800 0.00 0.12 89.09 0.89 3 10000 0.00 0.16 88.95 0.89 3 10200 0.00 0.17 89.01 0.89 4 10400 0.00 0.10 89.07 0.89 4 10600 0.00 0.12 89.14 0.89 4 10800 0.00 0.12 89.15 0.89 4 11000 0.00 0.11 89.09 0.89 4 11200 0.00 0.13 89.03 0.89 4 11400 0.00 0.09 89.11 0.89 4 11600 0.00 0.11 89.28 0.89 4 11800 0.00 0.18 89.15 0.89 4 12000 0.00 0.14 89.33 0.89 4 12200 0.00 0.09 89.22 0.89 4 12400 0.00 0.15 89.22 0.89 5 12600 0.00 0.10 89.08 0.89 5 12800 0.00 0.11 89.17 0.89 5 13000 0.00 0.15 89.24 0.89 5 13200 0.00 0.12 89.20 0.89 5 13400 0.00 0.12 89.08 0.89 5 13600 0.00 0.15 89.18 0.89 ✔ Saved pipeline to output directory output-multiclass/model-last . .

Here&#39;s the content of the meta.json file for our multiclass classification model. . import json meta_path = &quot;/content/drive/MyDrive/Python/NLP/shopping_comments/spaCy-text-classification/spaCy-product-cat-model/model-best/meta.json&quot; with open(meta_path) as json_file: metrics = json.load(json_file) metrics . . {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;&#39;, &#39;components&#39;: [&#39;tok2vec&#39;, &#39;textcat&#39;], &#39;description&#39;: &#39;&#39;, &#39;disabled&#39;: [], &#39;email&#39;: &#39;&#39;, &#39;labels&#39;: {&#39;textcat&#39;: [&#39;平板&#39;, &#39;水果&#39;, &#39;洗髮水&#39;, &#39;衣服&#39;, &#39;酒店&#39;], &#39;tok2vec&#39;: []}, &#39;lang&#39;: &#39;zh&#39;, &#39;license&#39;: &#39;&#39;, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;pipeline&#39;, &#39;performance&#39;: {&#39;cats_f_per_type&#39;: {&#39;平板&#39;: {&#39;f&#39;: 0.8329853862, &#39;p&#39;: 0.9140893471, &#39;r&#39;: 0.7651006711}, &#39;水果&#39;: {&#39;f&#39;: 0.9107981221, &#39;p&#39;: 0.9525368249, &#39;r&#39;: 0.8725637181}, &#39;洗髮水&#39;: {&#39;f&#39;: 0.8430637386, &#39;p&#39;: 0.8827818284, &#39;r&#39;: 0.8067657611}, &#39;衣服&#39;: {&#39;f&#39;: 0.8985658409, &#39;p&#39;: 0.9303455724, &#39;r&#39;: 0.868885527}, &#39;酒店&#39;: {&#39;f&#39;: 0.9810741688, &#39;p&#39;: 0.9932677369, &#39;r&#39;: 0.9691763517}}, &#39;cats_macro_auc&#39;: 0.9846299582, &#39;cats_macro_auc_per_type&#39;: 0.0, &#39;cats_macro_f&#39;: 0.8932974513, &#39;cats_macro_p&#39;: 0.9346042619, &#39;cats_macro_r&#39;: 0.8564984058, &#39;cats_micro_f&#39;: 0.8939148603, &#39;cats_micro_p&#39;: 0.9357025697, &#39;cats_micro_r&#39;: 0.8557, &#39;cats_score&#39;: 0.8932974513, &#39;cats_score_desc&#39;: &#39;macro F&#39;, &#39;textcat_loss&#39;: 0.1365536493, &#39;tok2vec_loss&#39;: 0.0}, &#39;pipeline&#39;: [&#39;tok2vec&#39;, &#39;textcat&#39;], &#39;spacy_git_version&#39;: &#39;f4f46b617&#39;, &#39;spacy_version&#39;: &#39;&gt;=3.0.3,&lt;3.1.0&#39;, &#39;url&#39;: &#39;&#39;, &#39;vectors&#39;: {&#39;keys&#39;: 0, &#39;name&#39;: None, &#39;vectors&#39;: 0, &#39;width&#39;: 0}, &#39;version&#39;: &#39;0.0.0&#39;} .

We can also break down the metrics into specific categories, which are saved as the values of the cats_f_per_type key of performance. . per_cat_dict = performance[&#39;cats_f_per_type&#39;] per_cat_df = pd.DataFrame(per_cat_dict) per_cat_df . . 平板 水果 洗髮水 衣服 酒店 . p 0.914089 | 0.952537 | 0.882782 | 0.930346 | 0.993268 | . r 0.765101 | 0.872564 | 0.806766 | 0.868886 | 0.969176 | . f 0.832985 | 0.910798 | 0.843064 | 0.898566 | 0.981074 | . Previously, I also used the fasttext library to train a multiclass classification model on the same dataset. Here&#39;re the values of the parameters I set up. And the overall accuracy is 0.886, which is pretty close to our spaCy model. . {&#39;dim&#39;: 200, &#39;epoch&#39;: 5, &#39;loss&#39;: &#39;softmax&#39;, &#39;lr&#39;: 0.1, &#39;test_size&#39;: 0.2, &#39;window&#39;: 5, &#39;wordNgrams&#39;: 1} . And here&#39;s the breakdown for each category. One noticeable difference between the spaCy and fastText model is that the spaCy model has the highest scores in the HOTEL category (酒店) across all three metrics whereas the fastText model consistently performs the best in the TABLET category (平板) in terms of all three metrics. . . cat 平板 水果 洗髮水 衣服 酒店 . p 0.976 | 0.892 | 0.851 | 0.899 | 0.816 | . r 0.972 | 0.908 | 0.832 | 0.885 | 0.836 | . f 0.974 | 0.9 | 0.841 | 0.892 | 0.825 | . Recap . Like fastText, spaCy is good for training text classification models, and this task has become a no-brainer with the release of spaCy v3.0. Even in cases where both methods work equally well, spaCy still has an edge over fastText. That is, with spaCy you don&#39;t need to deal with text preprocessing or tokenization. So, watch this space-y! .",

            "title": "Adding a custom tokenizer to spaCy and extracting keywords",
            "content": ". Intro . spaCy is an industrial-strength natural language processing library in Python, and supports multiple human languages, including Chinese. For segmenting Chinese texts into words, spaCy uses Jieba or PKUSeg under the hood. However, neither of them beats CKIP Transformers in accuracy when it comes to traditional Chinese (see my previous post for a comparison). So I&#39;ll show how to plug in CKIP Transformers to spaCy to get the best out of both. . For the purpose of demonstration, I&#39;ll situate this integration in a pipeline for extracting keywords from texts. Compared with other NLP tasks, keyword extraction is a relatively easy job. TextRank and RAKE seem to be among the most widely adopted algorithms for keyword extraction. I tried most of the methods mentioned in this article, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be any easy-peasy implementation of TextRank or RAKE that produces decent results for traditional Chinese texts. So the first part of this post walks through a pipeline that actually works, and the second part records other methods that failed. I included the second part because I believe in this quote: . “We learn wisdom from failure much more than from success. We often discover what will do, by finding out what will not do; and probably he who never made a mistake never made a discovery.” ― Samuel Smiles . . Note: TextRank is based on Google&#8217;s PageRank, which is used to compute the rank of webpages. This article on Natural Language Processing for Hackers demonstrates the connection between the two. From it I learned a tidbit: I always assumed that Page as in PageRank refers to webpages, but it turns out to be the family name of Larry Page, the creator of PageRank. . Working pipeline . Set variables . Let&#39;s start with defining two variables that users of our keyword extraction program might want to modify: CUSTOM_STOPWORDS for a list of words that users definitely hope to exclude from keyword candidates and KW_NUM for the number of keywords that they&#39;d like to extract from a document. . CUSTOM_STOPWORDS = [ &quot;民眾&quot;,&quot;朋友&quot;,&quot;市民&quot;,&quot;人數&quot;, &quot;全民&quot;,&quot;人員&quot;,&quot;人士&quot;,&quot;里民&quot;, &quot;影本&quot;,&quot;系統&quot;, &quot;項目&quot;, &quot;證件&quot;, &quot;資格&quot;,&quot;公民&quot;, &quot;對象&quot;,&quot;個人&quot;, ] KW_NUM = 10 . Preprocess texts . I took an announcement from Land Administration Bureau of Kaohsiung City Goverment as a sample text, but you can basically take any text in traditional Chinese to test the program. . . Tip: To run the program with your own text, follow the following steps: .

Feed tokenized results to spacy using WhitespaceTokenizer . The official website of spaCy describes several ways of adding a custom tokenizer. The simplest is to define the WhitespaceTokenizer class, which tokenizes a text on space characters. The output of tokenization can then be fed into subsequent operations down the pipeline, including tagger for parts-of-speech (POS) tagging, parser for dependency parsing, and ner for named entity recognition. This is possible primarily because tokenizer creates a Doc object whereas the other three steps operate on the Doc object, as illustrated in this graph. . . Note: The original code for words is words = text.split(&quot; &quot;), but it caused an error to my text. So I revised it into words = text.strip().split(). . from spacy.tokens import Doc class WhitespaceTokenizer: def __init__(self, vocab): self.vocab = vocab def __call__(self, text): words = text.strip().split() return Doc(self.vocab, words=words) . Next, let&#39;s load the zh_core_web_sm model for Chinese, which we&#39;ll need for POS tagging. Then here comes the crucial part: nlp.tokenizer = WhitespaceTokenizer(nlp.vocab). This line of code sets the default tokenizer from Jieba to WhitespaceTokenizer, which we just defined above. . import spacy nlp = spacy.load(&#39;zh_core_web_sm&#39;) nlp.tokenizer = WhitespaceTokenizer(nlp.vocab) . Then we join the tokenized result from CKIP Transformers to a single string of space-seperated tokens. . token_str = &quot; &quot;.join(tokens) token_str . &#39;市府 地政局 109年度 第4 季 開發區 土地 標售 ， 共計 推出 8 標 9 筆 優質 建地 ， 訂 於 109年 12月 16日 開標 ， 合計 總底價 12 億 4049萬 6164 元 。 n n n n 第93 期 重劃區 ， 原 為 國軍 眷村 ， 緊鄰 國定 古蹟 - 「 原 日本 海軍 鳳山 無線 電信所 」 ， 市府 為 保存 古蹟 同時 活化 眷村 遷移 後 土地 ， 以 重劃 方式 整體 開發 ， 新 闢 住宅區 、 道路 、 公園 及 停車場 ， 使 本 區 具有 歷史 文化 內涵 與 綠色 休閒 特色 ， 生活 機能 更加 健全 。 地政局 首次 推出 1 筆 大 面積 土地 ， 面積 約 2160 坪 ， 地形 方整 ， 雙面 臨 路 ， 利於 規劃 興建 景觀 大樓 ， 附近 有 市場 、 學校 、 公園 及 大東 文化 園區 ， 距 捷運 大東站 、 鳳山 國中站 及 鳳山 火車站 僅 數 分鐘 車程 ， 交通 四通八達 ， 因 土地 稀少性 及 區位 條件 絕佳 ， 勢必 成為 投資人 追逐 焦點 。 n n n n 第87 期 重劃區 ， 位於 省道 台1線 旁 ， 鄰近 捷運 南 岡山站 ， 重劃 後 擁有 完善 的 道路 系統 、 公園 綠地 及 毗鄰 醒村 懷舊 文化 景觀 建築群 ， 具備 優質 居住 環境 及 交通 便捷 要件 ， 地政局 一 推出 土地 標售 ， 即 掀起 搶標 熱潮 ， 本 季 再 釋出 1 筆 面積 約 93 坪 土地 ， 臨 20 米 介壽路 及 鵬程東路 ， 附近 有 岡山 文化 中心 、 兆湘 國小 、 公13 、 公14 、 陽明 公園 及 劉厝 公園 ， 區位 條件 佳 ， 投資人 準備 搶進 ！ n n n n 第77 期 市地 重劃區 ， 位於 鳳山區 快速 道路 省道 台88 線 旁 ， 近 中山高 五甲 系統 交流道 ， 近年 推出 土地 標售 皆 順利 完銷 。 本 季 再 推出 2 筆 土地 ， 其中 1 筆 面積 約 526 坪 ， 臨 保華一路 ， 適合 商業 使用 ； 1 筆 面積 107 坪 ， 位於 代德三街 ， 自用 投資 兩 相宜 。 n n n n 高雄 大學 區段 徵收區 ， 為 北 高雄 優質 文教 特區 ， 優質 居住 環境 ， 吸引 投資人 進駐 ， 本 季 再 推出 2 標 2 筆 土地 ， 其中 1 筆 第三 種 商業區 土地 ， 面積 約 639 坪 ， 位於 大學 26街 ， 近 高雄 大學 正門 及 萬 坪 藍田 公園 ， 地形 方正 ， 使用 強度 高 ， 適合 興建 優質 住宅 大樓 ； 另 1 筆 住三 用地 ， 面積 約 379 坪 ， 臨 28 米 藍昌路 ， 近 高雄 大學 及 中山 高中 ， 交通 便捷 。 n n n n 另 第37 期 重劃區 及 前 大寮 農地 重劃區 各 推出 1 至 2 筆 土地 ， 價格 合理 。 n n n n 第4 季 土地 標售 作業 於 109年 12月 1日 公告 ， 投資 大眾 可 前往 地政局 土地 開發處 土地處 分科 索取 標售 海報 及 標單 ， 或 直接 上網 高雄 房地產 億年旺 網站 、 地政局 及 土地 開發處 網站 查詢 下載 相關 資料 ， 在 期限 前 完成 投標 ， 另 再 提醒 投標人 ， 本 年度 已 更新 投標單 格式 ， 投標 大眾 請 注意 應 以 新式 投標單 投標 以免 投標 無效 作廢 。 n n n n 為 配合 防疫 需求 ， 本 季 開標 作業 除 於 地政局 第一 會議室 辦理 外 ， 另 將 於 地政局 Facebook 粉絲 專頁 同步 直播 ， 請 大眾 多加 利用 。 n n n n 洽詢 專線 ： 3373 451 或 3314942 n n 高雄 房地產 億 年 旺 網站 （ 網址 ： ） n n 高雄市 政府 地政局 網站 （ 網址 ： ） n n 高雄市 政府 地政局 土地 開發處 網站 （ 網址 ： ）&#39; .

The POS tagging is made possible by the zh_core_web_sm model. Notice that spaCy uses coarse labels such as NOUN and VERB. By contrast, CKIP Transformers adopts a more fine-grained tagset, such as Nc for locative nouns and Nd for temporal nouns. Here&#39;re the POS labels for the same text produced by CKIP Transformers. We&#39;ll be using the spaCy&#39;s POS tagging to filter out words that we don&#39;t want in the candicate pool for keywords. . pos_tags = pos[0] print(pos_tags) .

Convert stopwords in spaCy from simplified to Taiwanese traditional . spaCy comes with a built-in set of stopwords (basically words that we&#39;d like to ignore), accessible via spacy.lang.zh.stop_words. To make good use of it, let&#39;s convert all the words from simplified characters to traditional ones with the help of OpenCC. . !pip install OpenCC import opencc . OpenCC does not just convert characters mechanically. It has the ability to convert words from simplified characters to their equivalent phrasing in Taiwan Mandarin, which is done by s2twp.json. . from spacy.lang.zh.stop_words import STOP_WORDS converter = opencc.OpenCC(&#39;s2twp.json&#39;) spacy_stopwords_sim = list(STOP_WORDS) print(spacy_stopwords_sim[:5]) spacy_stopwords_tra = [converter.convert(w) for w in spacy_stopwords_sim] print(spacy_stopwords_tra[:5]) .

If you&#39;re dealing with English texts, you can implement TextRank quite easily with textaCy, the tagline of which is NLP, before and after spaCy. But I couldn&#39;t get it to work for Chinese texts, so I had to implement TextRank from scratch. Luckily, I got a jump-start from this gist, which offers a blueprint for the following definitions. . from collections import OrderedDict import numpy as np class TextRank4Keyword(): &quot;&quot;&quot;Extract keywords from text&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self): self.d = 0.85 # damping coefficient, usually is .85 self.min_diff = 1e-5 # convergence threshold self.steps = 10 # iteration steps self.node_weight = None # save keywords and its weight def set_stopwords(self, custom_stopwords): &quot;&quot;&quot;Set stop words&quot;&quot;&quot; for word in set(spacy_stopwords_tra).union(set(custom_stopwords)): lexeme = nlp.vocab[word] lexeme.is_stop = True def sentence_segment(self, doc, candidate_pos, lower): &quot;&quot;&quot;Store those words only in cadidate_pos&quot;&quot;&quot; sentences = [] for sent in doc.sents: selected_words = [] for token in sent: # Store words only with cadidate POS tag if token.pos_ in candidate_pos and token.is_stop is False: if lower is True: selected_words.append(token.text.lower()) else: selected_words.append(token.text) sentences.append(selected_words) return sentences def get_vocab(self, sentences): &quot;&quot;&quot;Get all tokens&quot;&quot;&quot; vocab = OrderedDict() i = 0 for sentence in sentences: for word in sentence: if word not in vocab: vocab[word] = i i += 1 return vocab def get_token_pairs(self, window_size, sentences): &quot;&quot;&quot;Build token_pairs from windows in sentences&quot;&quot;&quot; token_pairs = list() for sentence in sentences: for i, word in enumerate(sentence): for j in range(i+1, i+window_size): if j &gt;= len(sentence): break pair = (word, sentence[j]) if pair not in token_pairs: token_pairs.append(pair) return token_pairs def symmetrize(self, a): return a + a.T - np.diag(a.diagonal()) def get_matrix(self, vocab, token_pairs): &quot;&quot;&quot;Get normalized matrix&quot;&quot;&quot; # Build matrix vocab_size = len(vocab) g = np.zeros((vocab_size, vocab_size), dtype=&#39;float&#39;) for word1, word2 in token_pairs: i, j = vocab[word1], vocab[word2] g[i][j] = 1 # Get Symmeric matrix g = self.symmetrize(g) # Normalize matrix by column norm = np.sum(g, axis=0) g_norm = np.divide(g, norm, where=norm!=0) # this is to ignore the 0 element in norm return g_norm # I revised this function to return keywords as a list def get_keywords(self, number=10): &quot;&quot;&quot;Print top number keywords&quot;&quot;&quot; node_weight = OrderedDict(sorted(self.node_weight.items(), key=lambda t: t[1], reverse=True)) keywords = [] for i, (key, value) in enumerate(node_weight.items()): keywords.append(key) if i &gt; number: break return keywords def analyze(self, text, candidate_pos=[&#39;NOUN&#39;, &#39;VERB&#39;], window_size=5, lower=False, stopwords=list()): &quot;&quot;&quot;Main function to analyze text&quot;&quot;&quot; # Set stop words self.set_stopwords(stopwords) # Pare text with spaCy doc = nlp(token_str) # Filter sentences sentences = self.sentence_segment(doc, candidate_pos, lower) # list of list of words # Build vocabulary vocab = self.get_vocab(sentences) # Get token_pairs from windows token_pairs = self.get_token_pairs(window_size, sentences) # Get normalized matrix g = self.get_matrix(vocab, token_pairs) # Initionlization for weight(pagerank value) pr = np.array([1] * len(vocab)) # Iteration previous_pr = 0 for epoch in range(self.steps): pr = (1-self.d) + self.d * np.dot(g, pr) if abs(previous_pr - sum(pr)) &lt; self.min_diff: break else: previous_pr = sum(pr) # Get weight for each node node_weight = dict() for word, index in vocab.items(): node_weight[word] = pr[index] self.node_weight = node_weight . Now we can create an instace of the TextRank4Keyword class and call the set_stopwords function with our CUSTOM_STOPWORDS variable. This created a set of stopwords resulting from the union of both our custom stopwords and spaCy&#39;s built-in stopwords. And only words that meet these two criteria would become candidates for keywords: . they are not in the set of stopwords; | their POS labels are one of those listed in candidate_pos, which includes NOUN and VERB by default. | . tr4w = TextRank4Keyword() tr4w.set_stopwords(CUSTOM_STOPWORDS) . Put it together . Let&#39;s put it all together by defining a main function for keyword extraction. . def extract_keys_from_str(raw_text): text = clean_all(raw_text) #clean the raw text ws = ws_driver([text]) #tokenize the text with CKIP Transformers tokenized_text = &quot; &quot;.join(ws[0]) #join a list into a string tr4w.analyze(tokenized_text) #create a spaCy Doc object with the string and calculate weights for words keys = tr4w.get_keywords(KW_NUM) #get top 10 keywords, as set by the KW_NUM variable return keys . Here&#39;re the top ten keywords for our sample text. The results are quite satisfactory. . keys = extract_keys_from_str(raw_text) keys = [k for k in keys if len(k) &gt; 1] keys .

As a comparison, here&#39;re the top 10 keywords produced by Jieba&#39;s implementation of TextRank, 7 of which are identical to the list above. Although extracting keywords with Jieba is quick and easy, it tends to give rise to wrongly segmented tokens, such as 政局 in this example, which should have been 地政局 for Land Administration Bureau. . import jieba.analyse as KE jieba_kw = KE.textrank(text, topK=10) jieba_kw .

Integration of CKIP Transformers with spaCy and the TextRank algorithm generates decent results for extracting keywords from texts in traditional Chinese. Although there are many Python libraries out there that implement TextRank, none of them works better than the TextRank4Keyword class crafted from scratch. Until I figure out how to properly add the TextRank component to the spaCy pipeline, I&#39;ll stick with my working pipeline shown here. As a final thought, spaCy recently released v3.0, which supports pretrained transformer models. I can&#39;t wait to give it a try and see how this would change the workflow of extracting keywords or other NLP tasks. But that&#39;ll have to wait until next post. .",

            "title": "Many ways to segment Chinese",
            "content": ". Intro . Unlike English, Chinese does not use spaces in its writing system, which can be a pain in the neck (or in the eyes, for that matter) if you&#39;re learning to read Chinese. In a way, it&#39;s like trying to make sense out of long German words like Lebensabschnittspartner, which roughly means &quot;the person I&#39;m with today&quot; (taken from David Sedaris&#39;s language lessons published on the New Yorker). We&#39;ll see how computer models can help us with breaking a stretch of Chinese text into words (called tokenization in NLP jargon). To give computer models a hard time, we&#39;ll test out this text without punctuations. . text = &quot;今年好煩惱少不得打官司釀酒剛剛好做醋格外酸養牛隻隻大如山老鼠隻隻死&quot; . This text is challenging not only because it can be segmented multiple ways but also because it could potentially express quite different meanings depending on how you interprete it. For instance, this part 今年好煩惱少不得打官司 could either mean &quot;This year will be great for you. You&#39;ll have few worries. Don&#39;t file any lawsuit&quot; or &quot;This year, you&#39;ll be very worried. A lawsuit is inevitable&quot;. Either way, it sounds like the kind of aphorism you&#39;d find in fortune cookies. Now that you know the secret to aphorisms being always right is ambiguity, we&#39;ll turn to five Python libraries for doing the hard work for us. . Jieba . Of the five tools to be introduced here, Jieba is perhaps the most widely used one, and it&#39;s even pre-installed on Colab and supported by spaCy. Unfortunately, Jieba told us that a lawsuit is inevitable this year... 😭 . import jieba tokens = jieba.cut(text) jieba_default = &quot; | &quot;.join(tokens) print(jieba_default) . . Building prefix dict from the default dictionary ... Dumping model to file cache /tmp/jieba.cache Loading model cost 0.741 seconds.

The result is quite satisfying, except for 酸養, which is not even a word. Jieba is famouse for being super fast. If we run the segmentation function 1000000 times, top results we got are 256 nanoseconds per loop! . %timeit jieba.cut(text) . . The slowest run took 12.90 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached. 1000000 loops, best of 3: 256 ns per loop . Let&#39;s write a function for later use. . def Jieba_tokenizer(text): tokens = jieba.cut(text) result = &quot; | &quot;.join(tokens) return result . PKUSeg .

Yet, PKUSeg has one nice feature absent from Jieba. . Users have the option to choose from four domain-specific models, including news, web, medicine, and tourism. . This can be quite helpful if you&#39;re specifically dealing with texts in any of the four domains. Let&#39;s test the news domain with the first paragraph of a news article about Covid-19 published on Yahoo News. . article = &#39;&#39;&#39; 台灣新冠肺炎連續第6天零本土病例破功！中央流行疫情指揮中心指揮官陳時中今天宣布國內新增4例本土確定病例，均為桃園醫院感染事件之確診個案相關接觸者，其中3例為案863之同住家人(案907、909、910)，研判與案863、864、865為一起家庭群聚案，其中1人（案907）死亡，是相隔8個月以來再添死亡病例；另1例為案889之就醫相關接觸者(案908)。此外，今天也新增6例境外移入確定病例，分別自印尼(案901)、捷克(案902)及巴西(案903至906)入境。衛福部桃園醫院感染累計達19例(其中1人死亡)，全台達909例、8死。 &#39;&#39;&#39; .

Here&#39;s the result with the model_name argument set to news. Both models made some mistakes here and there, but what&#39;s surprising to me is that the news-specific model even made a mistake when parsing 新冠肺炎, which literally means &quot;new coronavirus disease&quot; and refers to Covid-19. . pku = pkuseg.pkuseg(model_name=&#39;news&#39;) result = pku.cut(article) result = &quot; | &quot;.join(result) result . .

Recap . This post has tested five word segmentation libraries against two challenging Chinese texts. Here&#39;re the takeaways: . If you value speed more than anything, Jieba is definitely the top choice. If you&#39;re dealing with traditional Chinese, it is a good practice to first convert your texts to simplified Chinese before feeding them to Jieba. Doing this may produce better results. . | If you care more about accuracy instead, it&#39;s best to use CKIP Transformers. Its Level 2 and 3 produce consistent results whether your texts are in traditional or simplified Chinese. . | Finally, if you hope to levarage the power of NLP libraries such as spaCy and Texthero (by the way, their slogan is really awesome: from zero to hero), you&#39;ll have to go for Jieba or PKUSeg. I hope spaCy will also add CKIP to its inventory of tokenizers in the near future. . | .",

Several months into the journey of Python programming, I was already aware of visualization tools like Matplotlib Seaborn, and Plotly, which are commonly discussed on Medium. But I&#39;d never heard of Altair until I came across fastpages. Since I plan to keep writing on this fastpages-powered blog, I did some experiments with Altair. For illustration purprose, I&#39;ll be using the dataset of real estate prices in Kaohsiung, TW, which I&#39;ve cleaned and put together in my GitHub repo. For those of you who don&#39;t know Kaohsiung, it&#39;s selected by the New York Times as one of the 52 places to love in 2021. Maybe you&#39;ll consider buying an apartment in Kaohsiung after reading this post. Who knows? . Import dependencies . Altair is alrealdy pre-installed on Colab.

The limitation can be lifted by calling this function. . alt.data_transformers.disable_max_rows() . DataTransformerRegistry.enable(&#39;default&#39;) . According to the official documentation, this is not a good solution. But I did it anyway because I didn&#39;t know better. I was then able to make a plot, but it only took seconds for my Colab notebook to crash. So the lesson learned is this: . . Warning: Never disable the restriction for max rows if you&#8217;re dealing with a huge amount of data! . A better way to deal with this is to pass data by URL, which only supports json and csv files. So I converted my dataframe to csv and then uploaded it to my GitHub repo. Then all that&#39;s needed to start using Altair is the URL to that file. . with open(&#39;kh-house-prices.csv&#39;, &#39;w&#39;, encoding=&#39;utf-8&#39;) as file: df.to_csv(file, index=False) . . Tip: For Altair to load your dataset properly, make sure the dataset is viewable by entering the URL in your browser. If your dataset is stored on GitHub, that means the URL has to start with https://raw.githubusercontent.com rather than https://github.com. . This URL is the data source from which we&#39;ll be making all the charts. . url= &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/howard-haowen/kh-real-estate/main/kh-house-prices.csv&quot; . Simple charts . After we got the data loading and performance issue taken care of, let&#39;s break down the syntax of Altair. . I&#39;m a visual learner, so I personally think the easiest way to get started is to go to the Example Gallery and pick the kind of charts that you&#39;d like to draw. Most of the time, all you need to do is copy-paste the codes and change the data source as well as column names. . All fancy charts start with something simple.In the case of Altair, it&#39;s alt.Chart(), which takes either URL or a pandas DataFrame object (like df in our failed example above) as its argument. . Then you decide what kinds of marks you&#39;d like to draw on the chart by calling the .mark_X() function, where X could be circle if you want to represent an observation with a circle. Other types of marks used in this post include point, line, bar, and area. . Finally, you need to call the encode() function in order to map the properties of your dataset onto the chart you&#39;re making. In this example below, the function takes three arguments: . x for which column to be mapped to the x axis | y for which column to be mapped to the y axis | color for which column to be colored on the chart | . Once you pass url to alt.Chart() and the column names in your dataset to encode(), you&#39;ll get this chart. . alt.Chart(url).mark_circle().encode( x=&#39;built_date:T&#39;, y=&#39;price_per_sqm:Q&#39;, color=&#39;district:N&#39;,) . . . Note: If your data source is a dataframe, then column names are sufficient. But if your data source is an URL as is the case here, you have to specify your data types with :X right after the column names, where X can be one of these: . Q for quantitative data | O for ordinal data | N for nominal data | T for temporal data | G for geographic data | . And one thing that I like about Altair is that there&#39;re lots of predefined aggregate functions that you can use on the fly. For instance, you can pass temporal data to the function yearmonth(), which aggreates data points in terms of year and month. Or you can pass quantitative data to average(), which calculates the mean for you. This way, you won&#39;t have to create additional columns using pandas and keep your raw data as minimal as possible. . alt.Chart(url).mark_circle().encode( x=&#39;yearmonth(built_date):T&#39;, y=&#39;average(price_per_sqm):Q&#39;, color=&#39;district:N&#39;,) . . In pandas, we&#39;d filter data using df[FILTER]. In Altair, this is done by .transform_filter(). In the chart above, we see that the majority of data points gather in the lower right corner. So one way to zoom in is to set a range for built_year on the x axis, which represents the year a property was built. Suppose we want built_year to fall within 1950 and 2020, we do alt.FieldRangePredicate(field=&#39;built_year&#39;, range=[1950, 2020]). . alt.Chart(url).mark_circle().encode( x=&#39;yearmonth(built_date):T&#39;, y=&#39;average(price_per_sqm):Q&#39;, color=&#39;district:N&#39;,).transform_filter( alt.FieldRangePredicate(field=&#39;built_year&#39;, range=[1950, 2020]) ) . . Similarly, if we want price_per_sqm on the y axis, which represents property prices per square meter (in NT$ of course!) to be in the range of 10k and 300k, then we do alt.FieldRangePredicate(field=&#39;price_per_sqm&#39;, range=[10000, 300000]). . alt.Chart(url).mark_circle().encode( x=&#39;yearmonth(built_date):T&#39;, y=&#39;average(price_per_sqm):Q&#39;, color=&#39;district:N&#39;,).transform_filter( alt.FieldRangePredicate(field=&#39;price_per_sqm&#39;, range=[10000, 300000]) ) . . But what if we want to filter data from multiple columns? I found that an easy way to do that is to use datum.X, where X is a column name. Then the syntax is just like what you&#39;d see in pandas. Suppose we want built_year to be greater than 1950 and price_per_sqm less than 300k, then we do (datum.built_year &gt; 1950) &amp; (datum.price_per_sqm &lt; 300000). . . Important: It took me a while to figure what what kind of object datum is. It turns out that Altair is smart enough to take care of everything for you as long as you import datum. So be sure to do this: from altair import datum. . alt.Chart(url).mark_circle().encode( x=&#39;yearmonth(built_date):T&#39;, y=&#39;average(price_per_sqm):Q&#39;, color=&#39;district:N&#39;,).transform_filter( (datum.built_year &gt; 1950) &amp; (datum.price_per_sqm &lt; 300000) ) . . Finally, if you want to give viewers of your chart the liberty to zoom in and out, you can make an interactive chart simply by adding .interactive() to the end of your syntax. To see the effect, click on any grid of the following chart and then scroll your mouse or move two of your fingers up and down on your Magic Trackpad. . . Warning: Try not to make too many interactive charts if your dataset is huge because they can cause serious performance issues. That&#8217;s why I only made one interactive chart in this post. . alt.Chart(url).mark_circle().encode( x=&#39;yearmonth(built_date):T&#39;, y=&#39;average(price_per_sqm):Q&#39;, color=&#39;district:N&#39;,).transform_filter( (datum.built_year &gt; 1950) &amp; (datum.price_per_sqm &lt; 300000) ).interactive() . . I think that&#39;s enough for the basics and for you to keep the ball rolling. Coming up are some of the numerous fancy charts that you can make with Altair. . Complex charts . Suppose we want to create a scatter plot where viewers can focus on data points from a particular district of their choice, the .add_selection() function can be quite handy. Let&#39;s first check out the unique districts in the datasets. (Btw, there&#39;re more districts in Kaohsiung. These are simply more densely populated areas.) . districts = df.district.unique().tolist() districts . [&#39;鼓山區&#39;, &#39;前金區&#39;, &#39;前鎮區&#39;, &#39;三民區&#39;, &#39;楠梓區&#39;, &#39;左營區&#39;, &#39;鳳山區&#39;, &#39;新興區&#39;, &#39;苓雅區&#39;] . We first create a variable selection, which we&#39;ll pass to .add_selection() later. The selection itself is a built-in function called alt.selection_single(), which takes the following arguments: . name for the name you want to display in the selection area | fields for a list of column names that views can choose from | init for a dictionary specifying the default value for each selectable column | bind for a dictionary specifying the way a column is to be selected (in this case, alt.binding_select() for a drop down box) and its possible values (indicated by the argument options) | . Additionally, if we want to display information about a data point upon mouseover, we can pass a list of column names to the argument tooltip of the .encode() function. . Importantly, for the interaction to work, we have to add .add_selection(selection) right before the .encode() function. . selection = alt.selection_single( name=&#39;Select&#39;, fields=[&#39;district&#39;, ], init={&#39;district&#39;: &#39;左營區&#39;, }, bind={&#39;district&#39;: alt.binding_select(options=districts), } ) alt.Chart(url).mark_circle().add_selection(selection).encode( x=&#39;yearmonth(built_date):T&#39;, y=&#39;price_per_sqm:Q&#39;, color=alt.condition(selection, &#39;district:N&#39;, alt.value(&#39;lightgray&#39;)), tooltip=[&#39;property_type:N&#39;,&#39;property_area:Q&#39;,&#39;parking_area:Q&#39;, &#39;built_date:T&#39;,&#39;tradinng_date:T&#39;,&#39;price_per_sqm:Q&#39;], ).transform_filter( (datum.built_year &gt; 1950) &amp; (datum.price_per_sqm &lt; 200000) ) # add &quot;.interactive()&quot; at the end to make the chart interactive . . We can also make two charts and then concatenat them vertically by calling the function alt.vconcat(), which takes chart objects and data as its arguments. . selection = alt.selection_multi(fields=[&#39;district&#39;]) top = alt.Chart().mark_line().encode( x=&#39;yearmonth(built_date):T&#39;, y=&#39;mean(price_per_sqm):Q&#39;, color=&#39;district:N&#39; ).properties( width=600, height=200 ).transform_filter( selection ) bottom = alt.Chart().mark_bar().encode( x=&#39;yearmonth(trading_date):T&#39;, y=&#39;mean(price_per_sqm):Q&#39;, color=alt.condition(selection, alt.value(&#39;steelblue&#39;), alt.value(&#39;lightgray&#39;)) ).properties( width=600, height=100 ).add_selection( selection ) alt.vconcat( top, bottom, data=url ) . . We can make one chart respond to another chart based on selection on the second one. This can be useful when we want to have both a global and detailed view of the same chart. The key function we need is alt.Scale(). Watch the top chart change as you select different areas of the bottom chart. . brush = alt.selection(type=&#39;interval&#39;, encodings=[&#39;x&#39;]) base = alt.Chart(url).mark_area().encode( x = &#39;yearmonth(built_date):T&#39;, y = &#39;price_per_sqm:Q&#39; ).properties( width=600, height=200 ) upper = base.encode( alt.X(&#39;yearmonth(built_date):T&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(domain=brush)) ) lower = base.properties( height=60 ).add_selection(brush) upper &amp; lower . . Finally, you can also pick three random variables from your dataset and make a 3 times 3 grid of charts, with each varing in the x and y axis combination. To do that, we&#39;ll need to specify repetition in two places: once in the argument of the x and y axis (i.e. alt.repeat() within alt.X and alt.Y) and the other time in the outmost layer of the syntax (i.e. .repeat() at the very end). . alt.Chart(url).mark_circle().encode( alt.X(alt.repeat(&quot;column&quot;), type=&#39;quantitative&#39;), alt.Y(alt.repeat(&quot;row&quot;), type=&#39;quantitative&#39;), color=&#39;district:N&#39; ).properties( width=150, height=150 ).repeat( row=[&#39;property_area&#39;, &#39;price_per_sqm&#39;, &#39;built_year&#39;], column=[&#39;built_year&#39;, &#39;price_per_sqm&#39;, &#39;property_area&#39;] ) . . Recap . Altair is a Python library worth looking into if you want to show interactive charts on your websites and give your visitors some freedom to play with the outcome. This post only shows what I&#39;ve tried. If you wish to dig deeper into this library, uwdata/visualization-curriculum seems like a great resource, aside from the official documentation.

The results are pretty good. But the downside is that the ft model is huge in size. After being unzipped, the model file is about 6.74G. . fastText cbow 300 dimensions from ToastyNews in Cantonese . This article is what inpired me to write this post. The author trained a fastText model on articles written in Cantonese, which uses traditional characters. Here&#39;re the simple steps for loading his model, abbreviated here as hk. . Since his model is stored on GDrive, I find it more convenient to use the gdown library to download the model. . import gdown . url = &#39;https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?export=download&amp;confirm=4g-b&amp;id=1kmZ8NKYDngKtA_-1f3ZdmbLV0CDBy1xA&#39; output = &#39;toasty_news.bin.gz&#39; gdown.download(url, output, quiet=False) .

The file needs to be first unzipped to be loaded as a fastText model. An easy way to do that is the command !gunzip plus a file name. . !gunzip toasty_news.bin.gz . hk = fasttext.load_model(&#39;/content/toasty_news.bin&#39;) hk.get_dimension() . Warning : `load_model` does not return WordVectorModel or SupervisedModel any more, but a `FastText` object which is very similar. . 300 . The hk model covers 222906 words in total. . len(hk.words) . 222906 . fastText cbow 100 dimensions from Taiwan news in traditional Chinese . I trained a fastText model on 5816 articles of Taiwan news in traditional Chinese, most of them related to health and diseases. . tw = fasttext.load_model(path) # &quot;path&quot; is where my model is stored. tw.get_dimension() . Warning : `load_model` does not return WordVectorModel or SupervisedModel any more, but a `FastText` object which is very similar. . 100 . The tw model covers only 11089 words in total because it&#39;s trained on a much smaller corpus than the hk model. . len(tw.words) . 11089 . Comparison . My original plan was to compare all the three models and see what similar words they come up with given the same keyword. But the ft model is huge so I can&#39;t load all of them into RAM. The RAM limit on Colab is about 12G. So we&#39;ll just compare the tw and hk model. . Since we&#39;re not concerned with the degree of similarity, let&#39;s write a simple function to show just similar words. . def similar_words(keyword, model): top_10 = model.get_nearest_neighbors(keyword) top_10 = [w[1] for w in top_10] return top_10 . Then, calling the function similar_word(), with a keyword and a fastText model as the required arguments, shows the top ten words most similar to the keyword. . similar_words(&quot;疫情&quot;, hk) . [&#39;疫症&#39;, &#39;病疫情&#39;, &#39;武漢肺炎&#39;, &#39;疫潮&#39;, &#39;疫&#39;, &#39;新冠肺炎&#39;, &#39;疫調&#39;, &#39;疫市&#39;, &#39;新型冠狀病毒&#39;, &#39;疫病&#39;] . Now let&#39;s write a function to show the results of the two models side by side in a dataframe. . import pandas as pd models = {&#39;hk&#39;: hk, &#39;tw&#39;: tw} def compare_models(keyword, **models): hk_results = similar_words(keyword, models[&#39;hk&#39;]) tw_results = similar_words(keyword, models[&#39;tw&#39;]) data = {&#39;HKNews_&#39;+keyword: hk_results, &#39;TWNews_&#39;+keyword: tw_results} df = pd.DataFrame(data) return df .

It&#39;s interesting that similar words of &quot;總統&quot; (meaning &quot;the president&quot;) include &quot;蔡總統&quot; (meaning &quot;President Tsai&quot;, referring to Taiwan&#39;s incumbent president) according to the hk model but not the tw model. I&#39;d expect the opposite. . test = compare_models(&quot;總統&quot;, **models) test .

Again, it is the hk model, not the tw model, that knows &quot;蔡英文&quot; (meaning &quot;Tsai Ing-wen&quot;) is most similar to &quot;蔡總統&quot; (meaning &quot;President Tsai&quot;). The two linguistic terms have the same reference. . test = compare_models(&quot;蔡總統&quot;, **models) test . HKNews_蔡總統 TWNews_蔡總統 . 0 蔡英文 | 總統 | . 1 賴清德 | 主持 | . 2 馬英九 | 部長 | . 3 李總統 | 親臨 | . 4 林全 | 局長 | . 5 民進黨 | 陳建仁 | . 6 柯文哲 | 座談會 | . 7 總統 | 吳 | . 8 川普 | 副院長 | . 9 總統府 | 總統府 | . Finally, let&#39;s write a function to quickly compare a list of keywords. . def concat_dfs(keyword_list): dfs = [] for word in keyword_list: df = compare_models(word, **models) dfs.append(df) results = pd.concat(dfs, axis=1) return results . keywords = &quot;疫情 疫苗 病毒 肺炎 檢疫 流感 台灣&quot; key_list = keywords.split() concat_dfs(key_list) .

Recap . You can easily find out words most similar to a keyword that you&#39;re interested in just by loading a fastText model. And for it to work pretty well, you don&#39;t even need to have a huge corpus at hand. Even if you don&#39;t know how to train a model from scratch, you can still make good use of fastText by loading pretrained models, like those released by Facebook. In total, 157 languages are covered, including even Malay and Malayalam! (Btw, check out this Malayalam grammar that I wrote and is now archived on Semantic Scholar.) . Note: This is my first post written in Jupyter notebook. After I uploaded the .ipynb file to GitHub, the post didn&#8217;t show up automatically and I got a CI failing warning in my repo. Listed in the tip section below is what I did to fix the problem, though I&#8217;m not sure which of them was the key. . Tip: 1. requested an automatic update by following the instructions in the troubleshooting guide 2. deleted the backtick symbol in the summary section of the front matter 3. uploaded the .ipynb file straight from Colab to GitHub instead of doing this manually .",

            "content": ". There’s always an awesome list for X. . Don&#39;t reinvent the wheel is something you’ll hear a lot in the field of technology. That means, whenever possible, try to use existing tools out there instead of building from scratch. If you use GitHub long enough, you probably already know this: for almost everything you’d like to learn, there’s an awesome list for that, which collects all sorts of awesome resources, including tools and tutorials. All you need to do is search for awesome X on GitHub. Or better yet, there’s even a meta list of awesome lists on various topics, like sindresorhus/awesome. Included in it is an awesome list for linguistics, theimpossibleastronaut/awesome-linguistics, which is a good place to start learning about natural language processing (NLP) if you are a humanities major who knows nothing about programming, as I was about one year ago. To take one more example, I wish I had discovered keon/awesome-nlp much earlier, which could’ve saved me lots of time when I was still fumbling around and trying to wrap my head around how a tool, say gensim, fits into the broader picture of NLP. But sometimes the name of an awesome list doesn’t have the keyword awesome in it, such as this gem ivan-bilan/The-NLP-Pandect. In my opinion, although an awesome list by any other name would be as awesome, the The-NLP-Pandect repo would have got much more stars if awesome were in its name. . But the hardest part is to get the ball rolling. . However, awesome as they are, awesome lists can be quite intimidating to go through and easy to get lost in. And even when you are lucky enough to finally come across an awesome tool that you wanna try out, it sometimes takes lots of trials and errors to figure out the right way to get the ball rolling, especially when you are a fresh programmer. So on this blog, I plan to add my personal touch to various tools, documenting not only what I did right to get the ball rolling, but also what I did wrong to save you (or even future me) from abysmal frustration. For almost every tool, there is already a wide specturum of instructional documents available online, ranging from hardcore official documentations to professional posts on platforms like Medium. And this blog is meant to be a friendly complement to those. I’ll be writing in plain language because I was not trained for computer science or programming anyway. . The fast stack . I’d like to start with a series of tools that I dub the fast stack, including fastpages, fast.ai, fastText, and fastAPI. First of all, fastpages , designed by the awesome fast.ai team, is basically a template for building blogs (like this one!) within seconds. It does lots of awesome things for you hehind the scenes. Features that I like about it include: . automatically converts .md and .ipynb files on GitHub to posts on your blog | automatically adds links to Colab and GitHub | shows interactive visualizations of your data with the help of Altair | supports comments, tags, and fast search (super fast at that!) | is free from end to end | . Truth be told that I actually failed twice before I successfully set up this blog. The lesson learned is this: do exactly what’s said in the instructions! Humanities majors like me are often taught to be creative, but be sure to leave your creativity at the door when you set up computer programs. This then concludes my first post. Nothing is super technical here since it’s just a warm-up. I’ll save other tools in the fast stack for another day. . . I was clueless when I read PR in the instructions. It turns out to mean &#39;pull requests&#39;. Click on the tab that says &#39;pull requests&#39; when you are done forking the original repo. Then you&#39;re good to go by following the instructions there.",
