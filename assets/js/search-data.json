The ft model covers a whopping great number of words, 2000000 to be exact, because it&#39;s trained on a HUGE corpus. . len(ft.words) . 2000000 . Let&#39;s check out the top 10 words most similar to &quot;疫情&quot; (meaning &quot;pandemic situation&quot;) according to the ft model. The numbers indicate the degree of similarity. The larger the number, the greater the similarity. . ft.get_nearest_neighbors(&quot;疫情&quot;) .

The results are pretty good. But the downside is that the ft model is huge in size. After being unzipped, the model file is about 6.74G. . fastText cbow 300 dimensions from ToastyNews in Cantonese . This article is what inpired me to write this post. The author trained a fastText model on articles written in Cantonese, which uses traditional characters. Here&#39;re the simple steps for loading his model, abbreviated here as hk. . Since his model is stored on GDrive, I find it more convenient to use the gdown library to download the model. . import gdown . url = &#39;https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?export=download&amp;confirm=4g-b&amp;id=1kmZ8NKYDngKtA_-1f3ZdmbLV0CDBy1xA&#39; output = &#39;toasty_news.bin.gz&#39; gdown.download(url, output, quiet=False) . Downloading... From: https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?export=download&amp;confirm=4g-b&amp;id=1kmZ8NKYDngKtA_-1f3ZdmbLV0CDBy1xA To: /content/toasty_news.bin.gz 2.77GB [00:26, 106MB/s] . &#39;toasty_news.bin.gz&#39; . The file needs to be first unzipped to be loaded as a fastText model. An easy way to do that is the command !gunzip plus a file name. . !gunzip toasty_news.bin.gz . hk = fasttext.load_model(&#39;/content/toasty_news.bin&#39;) hk.get_dimension() . Warning : `load_model` does not return WordVectorModel or SupervisedModel any more, but a `FastText` object which is very similar. . 300 . The hk model covers 222906 words in total. . len(hk.words) . 222906 . fastText cbow 100 dimensions from Taiwan news in traditional Chinese . I trained a fastText model on 5816 articles of Taiwan news in traditional Chinese, most of them related to health and diseases. . tw = fasttext.load_model(path) # &quot;path&quot; is where my model is stored. tw.get_dimension() . Warning : `load_model` does not return WordVectorModel or SupervisedModel any more, but a `FastText` object which is very similar. . 100 . The tw model covers only 11089 words in total because it&#39;s trained on a much smaller corpus than the hk model. . len(tw.words) . 11089 . Comparison . My original plan was to compare all the three models and see what similar words they come up with given the same keyword. But the ft model is huge so I can&#39;t load all of them into RAM. The RAM limit on Colab is about 12G. So we&#39;ll just compare the tw and hk model. . Since we&#39;re not concerned with the degree of similarity, let&#39;s write a simple function to show just similar words. . def similar_words(keyword, model): top_10 = model.get_nearest_neighbors(keyword) top_10 = [w[1] for w in top_10] return top_10 . Then, calling the function similar_word(), with a keyword and a fastText model as the required arguments, shows the top ten words most similar to the keyword. . similar_words(&quot;疫情&quot;, hk) . [&#39;疫症&#39;, &#39;病疫情&#39;, &#39;武漢肺炎&#39;, &#39;疫潮&#39;, &#39;疫&#39;, &#39;新冠肺炎&#39;, &#39;疫調&#39;, &#39;疫市&#39;, &#39;新型冠狀病毒&#39;, &#39;疫病&#39;] . Now let&#39;s write a function to show the results of the two models side by side in a dataframe. . import pandas as pd models = {&#39;hk&#39;: hk, &#39;tw&#39;: tw} def compare_models(keyword, **models): hk_results = similar_words(keyword, models[&#39;hk&#39;]) tw_results = similar_words(keyword, models[&#39;tw&#39;]) data = {&#39;HKNews_&#39;+keyword: hk_results, &#39;TWNews_&#39;+keyword: tw_results} df = pd.DataFrame(data) return df . Let&#39;s test it out with the keyword &quot;疫情&quot;. . test = compare_models(&quot;疫情&quot;, **models) test . HKNews_疫情 TWNews_疫情 . 0 疫症 | 疫情國 | . 1 病疫情 | 因應 | . 2 武漢肺炎 | 防堵 | . 3 疫潮 | 切記 | . 4 疫 | 擴散 | . 5 新冠肺炎 | 屬地 | . 6 疫調 | 疫情處 | . 7 疫市 | 升溫 | . 8 新型冠狀病毒 | 警訊 | . 9 疫病 | 嚴峻 | . It&#39;s interesting that similar words of &quot;總統&quot; (meaning &quot;the president&quot;) include &quot;蔡總統&quot; (meaning &quot;President Tsai&quot;, referring to Taiwan&#39;s incumbent president) according to the hk model but not the tw model. I&#39;d expect the opposite. . test = compare_models(&quot;總統&quot;, **models) test . HKNews_總統 TWNews_總統 . 0 代總統 | 主持 | . 1 美國總統 | 總統府 | . 2 前總統 | 部長 | . 3 民選總統 | 親臨 | . 4 李總統 | 局長 | . 5 副總統 | 蘇益仁 | . 6 下任總統 | 幹事長 | . 7 總理 | 副院長 | . 8 首相 | 李明亮 | . 9 蔡總統 | 座談會 | . Again, it is the hk model, not the tw model, that knows &quot;蔡英文&quot; (meaning &quot;Tsai Ing-wen&quot;) is most similar to &quot;蔡總統&quot; (meaning &quot;President Tsai&quot;). The two linguistic terms have the same reference. . test = compare_models(&quot;蔡總統&quot;, **models) test . HKNews_蔡總統 TWNews_蔡總統 . 0 蔡英文 | 總統 | . 1 賴清德 | 主持 | . 2 馬英九 | 部長 | . 3 李總統 | 親臨 | . 4 林全 | 局長 | . 5 民進黨 | 陳建仁 | . 6 柯文哲 | 座談會 | . 7 總統 | 吳 | . 8 川普 | 副院長 | . 9 總統府 | 總統府 | . Finally, let&#39;s write a function to quickly compare a list of keywords. . def concat_dfs(keyword_list): dfs = [] for word in keyword_list: df = compare_models(word, **models) dfs.append(df) results = pd.concat(dfs, axis=1) return results . keywords = &quot;疫情 疫苗 病毒 肺炎 檢疫 流感 台灣&quot; key_list = keywords.split() key_list concat_dfs(key_list) .

Recap . You can easily find out words most similar to a keyword that you&#39;re interested in just by loading a fastText model. Even if you don&#39;t know how to train a model from scratch, you can still make good use of fastText by loading pretrained models, like those released by Facebook. In total, 157 languages are covered, including even Malay, Tagalog, and Cebuano! .",

            "content": "My First Post: Setting tone for this blog . . There’s always an awesome list for X. . Don&#39;t reinvent the wheel is something you’ll hear a lot in the field of technology. That means, whenever possible, try to use existing tools out there instead of building from scratch. If you use GitHub long enough, you probably already know this: for almost everything you’d like to learn, there’s an awesome list for that, which collects all sorts of awesome resources, including tools and tutorials. All you need to do is search for awesome X on GitHub. Or better yet, there’s even a meta list of awesome lists on various topics, like sindresorhus/awesome. Included in it is an awesome list for linguistics, theimpossibleastronaut/awesome-linguistics, which is a good place to start learning about natural language processing (NLP) if you are a humanities major who knows nothing about programming, as I was about one year ago. To take one more example, I wish I had discovered keon/awesome-nlp much earlier, which could’ve saved me lots of time when I was still fumbling around and trying to wrap my head around how a tool, say gensim, fits into the broader picture of NLP. But sometimes the name of an awesome list doesn’t have the keyword awesome in it, such as this gem ivan-bilan/The-NLP-Pandect. In my opinion, although an awesome list by any other name would be as awesome, the The-NLP-Pandect repo would have got much more stars if awesome were in its name. . But the hardest part is to get the ball rolling. . However, awesome as they are, awesome lists can be quite intimidating to go through and easy to get lost in. And even when you are lucky enough to finally come across an awesome tool that you wanna try out, it sometimes takes lots of trials and errors to figure out the right way to get the ball rolling, especially when you are a fresh programmer. So on this blog, I plan to add my personal touch to various tools, documenting not only what I did right to get the ball rolling, but also what I did wrong to save you (or even future me) from abysmal frustration. For almost every tool, there is already a wide specturum of instructional documents available online, ranging from hardcore official documentations to professional posts on platforms like Medium. And this blog is meant to be a friendly complement to those. I’ll be writing in plain language because I was not trained for computer science or programming anyway. . The fast stack . I’d like to start with a series of tools that I dub the fast stack, including fastpages, fast.ai, fastText, and fastAPI. Designed by the fast.ai team(not true, thanks go to Hamel Husain, who corrected me), fastpages is basically a template for creating a blog (like this one!) and does lots of awesome things for you hehind the scenes. Features that I like about it include: . automatically converts .md and .ipynb files on GitHub to posts on your website | automatically adds links to Colab and GitHub | shows interactive visualizations of the output of codes | supports comments | is free from end to end | . Truth be told that I actually failed twice before I successfully set up this blog. The lesson learned is this: do exactly what’s said in the instructions! Humanities majors like me are often taught to be creative, but be sure to leave your creativity at the door when you set up computer programs. This then concludes my first repo. Nothing is super technical here since it’s just a warm-up. I’ll save other tools in the fast stack for another day. . . I was clueless when I read PR in the instructions. It turns out to mean &#39;pull requests&#39;. Click on the tab that says &#39;pull requests&#39; when you are done forking the original repo. Then you&#39;re good to go by following the instructions there.",
