### From a linguist to an engineer 
<div style="text-align: justify;font-size:20px;font-family:Garmond">
My name is Haowen Jiang. I obtained a PhD of linguistics from <a href="https://www.rice.edu">Rice University</a> and spent most of my early career in academia doing research on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formosan_languages">indigenous languages of Taiwan</a>, all of them related to languages such as Tagalog and Malay/Indonesian. Then along came COVID-19, which disrupted most people's lives, including mine. Somehow I became hooked on machine learning and Python programming. After several months of self-learning, I transitioned from an IT muggle to an AI engineer. My current job primarily focuses on Natural Language Processing, including text classification, clustering, topic modeling, document similarity, and information retrieval.
