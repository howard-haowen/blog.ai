# From a linguist to an engineer 
My name is Haowen Jiang. I obtained a PhD of linguistics from [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) and spent most of my early career in academia doing research on [indigenous languages of Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formosan_languages), all of them related to languages such as Tagalog and Malay/Indonesian. Then along came COVID-19, which disrupted most people's lives, including mine. Somehow I became hooked on machine learning and Python programming. After several months of self-learning, I transitioned from an IT muggle to an AI engineer. My current job primarily focuses on Natural Language Processing, including text classification, clustering, topic modelling, document similarity, and information retrieval.
