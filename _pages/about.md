My name is Haowen Jiang. I got a PhD of linguistics from [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) and spent most of my early career in academia doing *theoretical* research on [indigenous languages of Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formosan_languages), all of them related to languages such as Tagalog and Malay/Indonesian. Then along came COVID-19, which disrupted most people's lives, including mine. Somehow I became hooked on machine learning and Python programming, and now I work as an AI engineer, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other AI-related *applicational* stuff.
