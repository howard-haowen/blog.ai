# How I learned Python from scratch

Before the outbreak of Covid-19, I couldn't write any single line of code. But by teaching myself Python and machine learning during the lockdown period, I ended up being an AI engineer in mid-September in 2020. So I was invited to give a mini-talk on how to learn Python from scratch. I came up with a 4B learning path, covering basics, badges, and bootstrapping, and blogging. For those interested in the details, click on the title page at the bottom to view the slides. At first, I didn't think the slides are worth sharing at all, but one of my old-time colleagues at Rice University told me that he saw them posted on LinkedIn and found them quite helpful. He even considered changing his career path and getting into data science. This is why I'm sharing the slides here.
