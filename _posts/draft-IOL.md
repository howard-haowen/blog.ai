# Training for the International Linguistics Olympiad

## Intro
Recently, I had the honor of being invited to give a training lecture to the Taiwan team for the [International Linguistics Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Linguistics_Olympiad). It's basically an annual competition where participants from countries all over the world get together to solve linguistics puzzles. You don't need to have official training in linguistics in order to solve those puzzles, though knowing some linguistics does help. That's why I was asked to give this lecture. 

## Past problem set

The whole point of the competition is not so much about , but to be able to work out the most plausible way of accounting for the patterns  

I chose this topic because I saw this following problem set from the 2018 competition, which happens to be relevant to one of my favorite research topics. 
The problem set comes from TerÃªna

## Lecture slides
The title of my lecture was  **verbal person marking & pronominal clitics**, which may sound like gibberish if you don't know anything about linguistics. Although the technical terms may sound obscure, the linguistic patterns they are meant to describe are in fact quite straightforward. Check out some examples in the lecture slides below.
