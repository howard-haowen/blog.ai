Welcome to my blog, which documents a linguist's learning journey to the world of AI and Python programming! My given name sounds just like two question words, <b>how</b> and <b>when</b>. So, what's covered here includes the <i>hows</i> for getting AI jobs done and <i>whens</i> for using the right tools created by the almighty open source community. This blog is basically a collection of my own learning records, which might be helpful to you if you are <strike>a newbie</strike> like me, chasing rabbits in the AI world. Mind you, I was trained for linguistics, not computer science or programming. What I'm offering is simply AI through a linguist's looking glass. If you'd like to be kept posted of new posts (<span style="font-family:'Courier New'">I don't feel guilty for creating yet another problem for NLP.</span>), please subscribe to <a href="https://howard-haowen.rohan.tw/blog.ai/feed.xml">the RSS feed</a> of this blog.
